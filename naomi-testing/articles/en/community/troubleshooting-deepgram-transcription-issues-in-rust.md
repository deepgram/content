# Troubleshooting Deepgram Transcription Issues in Rust
Audio transcription can be a complex field, particularly when working with different devices and encoding schemes. One Rust developer recently encountered an issue while using Deepgram's API to transcribe audio, finding inconsistencies between different audio input sources.

### The Problem

The developer was able to transcribe audio successfully from an output device but faced blank transcriptions when using a MacBook Pro's microphone. The setup involved resampling audio from 48 kHz to 16 kHz and using a VAD (Voice Activity Detection) model built in Silero.

### Attempted Solutions

The user tried various methods to diagnose the problem:
- Adjusting the hardcoded sample rate.
- Removing the VAD and resampling components.
- Testing different channel configurations.
- Switching between using WAV and raw data formats.

Despite these efforts, the transcription from the Mac microphone remained empty.

### Debugging Insights

Upon closer examination of the logs, similar data formats were passed to Deepgram's API for both the output and the microphone devices, indicating that the issue wasn't with the data format itself. This led to the user exploring other parameters set during the API request.

### The Solution

The core issue revolved around setting the `encoding` parameter incorrectly in Deepgram’s API request. Specifically, the value was set to `linear32`, which is not supported by Deepgram's expected encoding formats.

### Recommended Fixes

1. **Correct Encoding:** Ensure the encoding type used is valid according to Deepgram’s supported types. Supported encodings include formats like `pcm_f16le` or `linear16`.

2. **Verify Headers:** Drop the encoding parameter entirely and ensure any necessary headers are correctly formatted before sending the audio data.

3. **Audio Configuration:** Consider converting the data to `pcm_f16le`, which is more widely compatible with transcription services.

4. **Consistent Testing:** Temporarily remove optional transformations like resampling or VAD to test transcription with basic settings.

5. **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Double-check the audio data’s integrity from various input devices and formats to ensure consistency across platforms.

By revisiting the parameters defined in their transcription requests, the user was able to resolve the issue and attain successful transcriptions from the MacBook Pro's microphone. 

### Conclusion
While dealing with audio transcriptions, particularly when leveraging APIs like Deepgram, it’s crucial to align your data formatting parameters with the API's supported types. Misconfigurations can lead to unexpected results, such as empty transcriptions, as seen in this case. By following the recommended solutions, users can ensure more consistent results across different audio input sources.

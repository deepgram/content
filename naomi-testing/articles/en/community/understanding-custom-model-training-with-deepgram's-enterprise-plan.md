# Understanding Custom Model Training with Deepgram's Enterprise Plan
In the ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence, developing a speech recognition model that accurately understands and processes voice data is a key objective for many researchers and developers. Deepgram, a leader in AI-powered speech technologies, offers advanced solutions for those looking to train specialized models. However, it's important to note that this level of customization comes with requirements that are beyond the scope of the standard offerings.

### Deepgram's Custom Model Training

Custom model training at Deepgram involves tailoring a speech recognition system to a particular use case or set of vocabulary that differs significantly from general-purpose speech models. This includes, but is not limited to, adapting to specific terminology, accents, languages, or industry jargon. Such custom models can significantly enhance the accuracy and usefulness of speech recognition applications in various fields.

#### Availability and Plan Requirements

For those interested in utilizing this advanced feature, it's crucial to understand that custom model training is exclusively available through Deepgram's **Enterprise Plan**. This doesn't mean smaller developers or teams are left without options, but it does require considering the business case for upgrading to a level of service that supports extensive customization.

The Enterprise Plan is designed to meet the needs of organizations that require advanced functionality, scalability, and dedicated support. This plan provides the resources and infrastructure necessary to train models at scale, with the option to integrate Deepgram's technology deeply into existing systems.

#### Benefits of Custom Model Training

1. **Higher Accuracy**: By tailoring a model to understand specific languages or dialects, businesses can achieve much higher accuracy rates.

2. **Industry Specialization**: Fields like healthcare or legal, which involve specialized terminologies, can benefit from models trained with custom datasets for unrivaled precision.

3. **Scalability and Support**: With the Enterprise Plan, organizations receive support from Deepgram's team of experts, ensuring that the deployment of custom models is efficient and effective.

### Conclusion

For those seeking to elevate their speech recognition capabilities, custom model training represents a powerful tool. However, due to its complex nature and the resources required, this service is part of Deepgram's exclusive Enterprise offering. If you're considering this path, weigh the potential benefits of customized models against the investment in the Enterprise Plan.

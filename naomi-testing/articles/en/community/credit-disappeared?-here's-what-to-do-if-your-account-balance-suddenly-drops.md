# Credit Disappeared? Here's What to Do If Your Account Balance Suddenly Drops

If you’ve ever logged into your account expecting to see your available credit intact, only to find a big, fat zero staring back at you, you’re not alone. This mystery case of the disappearing credit is more common than you might think, and it’s understandably alarming, especially if you’re in the heat of a production project. Here’s what you need to know about why this might happen and how to fix it.

### Discovering the Issue

Imagine this: you just set up your account last week. You were excited to see a $200 credit staring at you, a little cushion to help you get started. Then, seemingly overnight, it vanished without a trace or explanation under your usage history.

#### Sound Familiar?

Users, like Rob from Cosmic Marketing and others, have experienced this silent disappearing act of credits. In fact, Rob noticed his summer credits had gone missing, sparking concern over potential losses and problems when recharging. 

#### Immediate Reaction

First things first, don't panic. While this scenario can be startling, it's often a solvable software hiccup rather than an indication of permanent loss.

### Sorting Out the Fine Print

**Project Expiry and Replenishment:**

Turns out, accounts sometimes lose credits if they were set during a period when credit expiry policies differed. While this isn’t the case anymore—since many platforms no longer auto-expire credits—users falling into this timeline gap may see their credits vanish incorrectly.

#### What to Do Next?

1. **Contact Support:**
    - Immediately reach out to your platform’s support team. Providing your project IDs is essential as it helps the support team trace where credits should be.

2. **Check for System-Wide Issues:**
    - See if others have reported similar issues. If it’s a widespread problem, relief may be on its way already, as staff become alerted and resolve system-wide bugs.

3. **Direct Requests for Credit Refill:**
    - If your account remains empty post-contacting support, directly request a credit replenishment. Being vocal about unexpected losses helps services identify and rectify underlying issues.

### Commitment to Resolution

Dedicated support teams, as seen in Rob’s case, are often prompt in replenishing lost credits. After validation, immediate corrective action should soon reflect in your account, restoring both the available balance and your confidence in future transactions.

### Staying Informed

Ensure you stay updated with your account and platform policy changes. Being well-informed can prevent incidents from catching you off-guard and ensure a smooth user experience moving forward.

While unexpected zeros on your credit balance can cause momentary panic, understanding the causes and knowing the steps to remedy the situation makes managing your account a much more stress-free affair. Always remember, effective collaboration with your support team is crucial for swift problem-solving, enabling you to get back to what matters—your projects.

## Reviewing Community Articles


## ONLY Instructions
- ONLY apply these rules to markdown files inside `articles/en/commumity`
- ONLY include very small code examples exactly as they are in the docs
- ONLY use frontmatter for the article's title
- ONLY reference official Deepgram documentation
- ONLY use absolute URLs for documentation references
- ONLY include API keys in example code as placeholders (e.g., `YOUR_API_KEY`)

## ALWAYS Instructions
- ALWAYS add frontmatter when missing, based on the content - including a `title`, `summary` and `description`.
- ALWAYS add frontmatter tags in this format: `tags: ["Errors", "Troubleshooting"]`
- ALWAYS add frontmatter categories in this format: `categories: ["API"]`
- ALWAYS add frontmatter dates in ISO format.
- ALWAYS compare articles for accuracy against known Deepgram API Specs (openapi.yml and asyncapi.yml)
- ALWAYS check articles for accuracy against similar content on https://developers.deepgram.com
- ALWAYS include a clear problem statement at the beginning of troubleshooting articles
- ALWAYS provide complete error messages when discussing error resolution
- ALWAYS use proper syntax highlighting for code blocks (e.g., \```python, \```javascript, \```shell)
- ALWAYS include a "References" section with relevant documentation links
- ALWAYS add appropriate metadata (tags, categories, last updated date)
- ALWAYS test all code examples before publication
- ALWAYS include error handling in code examples
- ALWAYS use British English spelling and terminology
- ALWAYS provide alternative solutions where applicable
- ALWAYS include community support links (Discord, GitHub Discussions)
- ALWAYS prefer latest models (Nova 3 > Nova 2 > Nova)
- ALWAYS prefer latest features (keyterm prompting > keywords - but it requires Nova 3)

## NEVER Instructions
- NEVER use Deepgram or a product name as an article tag.
- NEVER include actual API keys or sensitive credentials

- NEVER publish untested code examples
- NEVER use absolute URLs for internal documentation
- NEVER publish content without proper error handling examples

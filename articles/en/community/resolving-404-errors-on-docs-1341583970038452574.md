# Resolving 404 Errors on Deepgram Documentation Site

Occasionally, users may encounter a situation where the Deepgram documentation site seems to be down and returns a 404 error, even when the status page indicates that the service is operational. Such issues typically result from unexpected service outages, often related to our documentation hosting provider.

### Encountering a 404 Error

When you face a 404 error accessing Deepgram's documentation, it's essential to verify if the issue is widespread or isolated. This can be done by checking:

- **Deepgram Status Page:** Ensure that you confirm the status of Deepgram's services at [status.deepgram.com](https://status.deepgram.com).
- **Community Channels:** Access community platforms such as [Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram) to see if other users are experiencing the same issue or if there are any real-time updates.

### Temporary Solutions

If you find that the documentation site is temporarily inaccessible:

- **Archive Access:** You may use services like [archive.org](https://archive.org) to retrieve cached versions of the documentation. However, note that this is not a comprehensive solution, as some parts of the documentation may not be fully accessible.
- **Related Requests:** If urgent information is required, reach out to our community for assistance, where staff or experienced users can guide you based on your specific needs.

### Resolution and Monitoring

Deepgram actively monitors and addresses such outages to minimize disruption:

- **Monitoring:** Our team continuously monitors major service providers to ensure smooth access to documentation and addresses outages as swiftly as possible.
- **Communication:** In the event of an outage, we strive to keep our channels updated with real-time information about the status and expected resolution timelines.

If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [https://discord.gg/deepgram](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

### Conclusion

Encountering a 404 error on the documentation site can be inconvenient, especially for new users onboarding with Deepgram's services. Following the guidelines for temporary access and leveraging our support channels can help alleviate immediate challenges until the service is fully restored.

<CommunityQuestion>I've been using Deepgram's live transcription API, but I'm running into an issue where the audio duration keeps returning as 0. What could be causing this, and how can I troubleshoot it?</CommunityQuestion>

## Understanding the Issue

When you receive an audio duration of 0, coupled with a WebSocket status code of `1011` and payload `NET-0001`, it indicates that the connection to Deepgram's API was successful, but no audio was received. This usually points to issues with the audio stream configuration or network disruptions.

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Verify Audio Transmission

- **Check for Audio Data:** Ensure that the audio data is actually being sent over the WebSocket. You can log the audio data being sent or write it to a file for verification.

### 2. WebSocket Configuration

- **Correct Setup:** Double-check your WebSocket configuration to ensure it matches Deepgram's requirements. Here is a basic example demonstrating a correct setup:

  ```javascript
  const WebSocket = require('ws');
  const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen', {
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Token YOUR_API_KEY',
      },
  });

  ws.on('open', function open() {
    // Send audio data here
  });

  ws.on('error', function error(err) {
    console.error('WebSocket Error: ', err.message);
  });
  ```

  Ensure error handling is in place to capture and log connection issues for further analysis.

### 3. Network Stability

- **Check Network Issues:** Use tools like `ping` or `traceroute` to diagnose potential network problems. Ensure your connection is stable and has low latency.

### 4. Monitor Status Transitions

- **Deepgram Console Logs:** Monitor your request status in the Deepgram console. Transitions from "Pending" to "Unknown" to "Lost" indicate WebSocket payload issues.

### Conclusion

Proper configuration and testing of your audio streaming setup are crucial for effective use of Deepgramâ€™s live transcription services. Regular log checks, stream tests in various scenarios, and consistent debugging practices can help maintain a stable connection with Deepgram's API.

<CommunityQuestion>How can I integrate Deepgram's speech-to-text API for transcribing audio in my Android application? I'm looking for a way to transcribe audio from the device's microphone without needing a dedicated SDK.</CommunityQuestion>

Deepgram provides flexible and robust APIs that can be used for audio transcription tasks across multiple platforms, including Android. While Deepgram's SDKs are available for programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, Go, .NET, and Rust, using the REST API directly allows you to implement transcription functionality without needing a dedicated SDK for Java or Kotlin.

## Getting Started with Audio Transcription on Android

To transcribe streaming audio input from an Android device's microphone, you can utilise Deepgram’s Live Transcription API. The API operates via a WebSocket connection and supports integration in Java-based languages for Android applications.

### Steps to Transcribe Audio Using the Deepgram API:

1. **Gather Required Libraries:** You'll need to use libraries that support WebSockets in Java or Kotlin. Popular libraries include [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/).

2. **Set Up WebSocket Connection:** Establish a WebSocket connection to Deepgram’s Live Transcription endpoint, `wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen`, and provide your authentication token.

3. **Capture Audio:** Use Android's audio capture functionality to get audio data from the microphone. Process this audio data so it can be streamed in real-time to the WebSocket connection.

4. **Send Audio for Transcription:** Stream the captured audio to the API endpoint through the WebSocket. The API will process the audio in real-time and provide transcriptions.

5. **Handle Transcription Responses:** Implement handlers to receive transcription results from the WebSocket, which can then be displayed or processed in your application as needed.

6. **Error Handling:** Ensure to handle potential errors during WebSocket connection or audio processing. Here's an example:

   ```java
   WebSocket webSocket = ...; // Initialize WebSocket
   webSocket.setSocketListener(new WebSocketListener() {
       @Override
       public void onFailure(WebSocket webSocket, Throwable t, Response response) {
           System.err.println("WebSocket Error: " + t.getMessage());
       }

       @Override
       public void onMessage(WebSocket webSocket, String text) {
           // Process incoming transcription
           System.out.println("Transcription: " + text);
       }

       @Override
       public void onClosed(WebSocket webSocket, int code, String reason) {
           System.out.println("WebSocket closed: " + reason);
       }
   });
   ```

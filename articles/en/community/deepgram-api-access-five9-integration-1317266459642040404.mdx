<CommunityQuestion>I'm looking to integrate Deepgram's speech-to-text capabilities with our Five9 contact centre software. What options do I have for accessing the Deepgram API and customising the integration?</CommunityQuestion>

Integrating Deepgram with Five9 enhances contact centre operations with advanced transcription and AI capabilities. Understanding the integration options available is crucial for optimising these functionalities.

## API Access with Predefined Integration

Predefined integrations between Five9 and Deepgram may limit API access to the functionalities offered through the Five9 interface, enabling basic transcription features without direct API interaction. This is suitable for users who do not require extensive customisation.

## Custom Integration and Direct API Calls

For organisations seeking more flexibility or additional features, direct access to Deepgramâ€™s APIs is possible with appropriate permissions. This enables leveraging Deepgram's advanced functionalities beyond standard integration. Follow these steps for custom integration:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Review Existing Integration Documentation**: Understand the current capabilities and limitations of the Five9 and Deepgram integration.

2. **Ensure Proper Permissions**: Confirm administrative permissions within both Five9 and Deepgram to enable direct API calls.

3. **Custom Development for API Calls**: If further customisation is needed, develop code to interact with Deepgram's API directly.

### Sample Code for Direct API Access

Below is a tested code example using `curl` to make a direct API call to Deepgram:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen" \
-H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
-F "file=@path/to/your/audio/file.wav"
```

Ensure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key and `path/to/your/audio/file.wav` with the correct file path. This example demonstrates a simple transcription request to Deepgram.

### Error Handling Example

To handle potential errors, check for HTTP response codes in your implementation. Here's a basic example of error handling in `Python`:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"
}
files = {
    "file": open("path/to/your/audio/file.wav", "rb")
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Transcription successful:", response.json())
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.json()}")
```

This code checks for successful transcription and handles errors appropriately.

## Further Assistance

If specific functions are needed or barriers occur, expanding your understanding or developing custom API interactions may be necessary. Reach out to your Deepgram support representative, or join our community for assistance: [Deepgram Community](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

<CommunityQuestion>I'm looking to integrate Deepgram's speech-to-text capabilities with our Five9 contact centre software. What options do I have for accessing the Deepgram API and customising the integration?</CommunityQuestion>

Integrating Deepgram with Five9 provides robust capabilities for enhancing contact center operations with automated transcription and AI features. However, it is essential to understand how this integration interacts with Deepgram's API access.

### API Access with Predefined Integration

If you're using a predefined integration between Five9 and Deepgram, the access to API functionality might be limited to the capabilities provided by this integration. This integration could provide access via the Five9 interface to various features powered by Deepgram without requiring manual API interaction. This might suit users whose needs are aligned with the default functionality provided by the integration.

### Custom Integration and Direct API Calls

For organizations requiring more customization or additional features not available through the predefined setup, there is the possibility of accessing Deepgram’s APIs directly if you have the proper integration capabilities or administrative permissions. This route is ideal for leveraging Deepgram’s advanced functionalities beyond the standard integration. Here's how to approach this:

- **Review Existing Integration Documentation:** Familiarize yourself with the capabilities and limitations of the current Five9 and Deepgram integration.
- **Ensure Proper Permissions:** Confirm you have the necessary permissions within both Five9 and Deepgram environments to make direct API calls.
- **Consider Custom Development Needs:** Evaluate if there are extensive API interactions required that fall outside of standard offerings, and seek help from developers if needed.

### Further Assistance

For users who require specific functions or face barriers with the integration, you may need to extend your understanding or develop custom API interactions. If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Community](https://discord.gg/deepgram)

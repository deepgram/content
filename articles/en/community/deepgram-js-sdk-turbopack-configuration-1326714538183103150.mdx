<CommunityQuestion>I'm building a web application that uses the Deepgram JS SDK, but I'm running into compatibility issues with Turbopack, the bundler I'm using. How can I properly configure the SDK to work seamlessly with Turbopack?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

Integrating the Deepgram JavaScript SDK with Turbopack can present compatibility challenges. Turbopack is a newer bundler offering performance benefits but may require special configuration to work with certain SDKs, such as Deepgram's.

### Understanding Turbopack Compatibility

Turbopack is designed to optimise build performance for JavaScript applications. However, due to its novel approach, it may not automatically handle all dependencies or module resolutions as expected, especially with SDKs like Deepgram's JavaScript SDK.

### Steps to Ensure Compatibility

1. **Install Dependencies Properly**:
   Ensure that all required dependencies for the Deepgram SDK are installed. Use the following command to add the Deepgram SDK to your project:

   ```shell
   npm install @deepgram/sdk
   ```

2. **Configure Turbopack**:
   Adjust Turbopack's configuration to handle the SDK's requirements. This might include specifying custom resolutions or plugins. Refer to Turbopack's [documentation](https://turbopack.dev/docs) for detailed configuration options.

3. **Example Configuration**:
   Here is a basic example of how you might set up a Turbopack configuration to work with the Deepgram JS SDK:

   ```javascript
   // turbopack.config.js
   module.exports = {
     entry: './src/index.js',
     resolve: {
       extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '.json'],
       alias: {
         '@deepgram/sdk': require.resolve('@deepgram/sdk'),
       },
     },
   };
   ```

4. **Error Handling**:
   When integrating, you might encounter errors such as module resolution failures. Here is an example of how to handle potential errors:

   ```javascript
   import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

   try {
     const deepgram = createClient("YOUR_API_KEY");
     // Use the SDK...
   } catch (error) {
     console.error("Failed to initialize Deepgram SDK:", error.message);
   }
   ```

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   Conduct incremental tests to isolate issues, and utilise detailed error logs provided by Turbopack. This will help identify specific compatibility problems.

### Conclusion

As Turbopack and SDKs like Deepgram's evolve, keeping abreast of updates is essential. Regularly check Turbopack's and Deepgram's documentation for the latest guidance on integration.

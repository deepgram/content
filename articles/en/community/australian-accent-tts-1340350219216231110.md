# Exploring Australian Accents in Text-to-Speech

Deepgram offers a variety of text-to-speech (TTS) voices across different languages and regions. However, when it comes to specific regional accents, such as a female Australian voice, the availability can be more limited.

# Availability of Australian Accents
Currently, Deepgram's priority is to ensure high-quality TTS and speech-to-text (STT) models for the most widely used accents and languages. However, offering region-specific accents, like Australian English, is subject to development timelines and demand.

As of now, there is no immediate confirmation of when a female Australian accent will be available in the TTS offerings. However, Deepgram is continually working on expanding its range and features based on customer feedback and demand.

# Using Text-to-Speech with Deepgram
For many applications, one of the existing English voices may suffice. Users are encouraged to test the voices available and provide feedback which might influence the release of new accent features.

Connect with your Deepgram support representative or visit the Deepgram community forums to stay updated on new features and offerings.

# Additional Resources
If you're building applications that can integrate with existing Deepgram TTS offerings, you may explore the [Deepgram TTS API documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/tts-rest) and [Deepgram Community](https://community.deepgram.com) for ongoing discussions and updates.

For specific product requirements, external tools like [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) can also be leveraged for audio processing needs which can work alongside Deepgram's API.

# Conclusion
While specific regional voices such as Australian may not be immediately available, Deepgram continues to improve its offerings based on community demand. If you have specific needs or would like to express interest in regional accent features, reach out to Deepgram through official support channels or join the community forums where future updates will be shared.

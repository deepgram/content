<CommunityQuestion>I've been using the Deepgram speech-to-text API, but some of my requests seem to be getting stuck in an 'Unknown' status. What could be causing this, and how can I troubleshoot the issue?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

When using Deepgram's API, you might encounter requests that result in an 'Unknown' status. Understanding and addressing these instances is essential for maintaining a seamless workflow and ensuring your API calls perform as expected.

## Understanding the Unknown Status

In Deepgram's usage logs, requests with an 'Unknown' status suggest that the system could not successfully process them. While these logs might occasionally turn into 'Success' after further processing, frequent occurrences necessitate further investigation.

For details about different log states and their meanings, see [Understanding Console Usage Log States](/docs/using-logs-usage#understanding-console-usage-log-states).

## Common Causes of Unknown Status

1. **Invalid Audio Data**: 
   - **Empty or Improperly Formatted Files**: The audio file might be empty or not in a supported format. Verify that the file contains valid audio data.
   - **Verification Steps**: Compare the audio data of successful requests to those resulting in an 'Unknown' status to pinpoint discrepancies.

## Request Parameter Recommendations

1. **Correct Parameter Usage**:
   - Ensure correct spelling of query parameters, such as using `paragraphs` instead of `paragraph`.
   - When using smart formatting features, setting `smart_format` to `true` eliminates the need to explicitly include `paragraphs` or `punctuate`.

For more information, see [Smart Format](/docs/smart-format).

## Error Handling Strategies

- Implement proper error handling to manage unexpected API responses. Log errors with specific error codes and responses to aid in troubleshooting.
- Monitor the [Deepgram Status Page](https://status.deepgram.com) to check for any operational issues.

## Conclusion

By ensuring your audio files are valid and correctly formatted, and your request parameters are accurately set, you can minimise instances of 'Unknown' status in Deepgram API requests.

## Whisper 3 and Nova-3 on Deepgram: Enhancing Transcription

Our community has been curious about the potential inclusion of Whisper 3 in the Whisper Cloud services and the upcoming Nova-3 solutions. As of now, Deepgram has no immediate plans to integrate Whisper 3 into the infrastructure.

### Transcription Quality Comparison

Feedback suggests that Whisper 3 provides superior transcription results under challenging conditions, such as noisy environments with overlapping speakers. This has prompted interest in integrating Whisper 3 capabilities with Deepgram's renowned diarizer technology.

### Diarization Excellence

Deepgram's diarizer has been praised for its exceptional performance, facilitating the selection of our services despite differing transcription quality comparisons. The diarizer's ability to distinguish between speakers makes it a preferred choice for those needing clarity in multi-speaker scenarios.

### Future Developments: Nova-3

In terms of advancing our proprietary architecture, Deepgram is working on Nova-3. This upcoming model is expected to elevate transcription accuracy and efficiency. While a release date for Nova-3 is not yet public, efforts are underway to enhance the model further and provide top-tier transcription services.

### Conclusion

Both Whisper 3 and Nova-3 hold promise for improving transcription quality and user satisfaction. As Deepgram continues to innovate, we appreciate the community's feedback on our diarizer and its vital role in your operational preferences.

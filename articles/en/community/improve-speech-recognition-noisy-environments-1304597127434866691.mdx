<CommunityQuestion>My startup is developing an app that leverages speech recognition to transcribe audio recordings, but we're having trouble with noisy environments like construction sites. How can we improve the accuracy of Deepgram's speech-to-text API when dealing with such challenging acoustic conditions?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

Accurate speech transcription in environments with significant background noise is challenging. This guide provides strategies to improve speech recognition accuracy using Deepgram's API and appropriate audio preprocessing steps.

## Introduction

Deepgram offers robust speech-to-text services through its API, which can effectively convert spoken language into text. However, when faced with noisy environments, applying preprocessing techniques to enhance speech clarity is crucial before using the API.

## Enhancing Speech Recognition

### Noise Reduction

Implementing noise reduction before sending audio to Deepgram can significantly improve clarity. Here are some libraries and tools you can leverage:

- **Python**: Use the `pydub` or `librosa` library for noise reduction filtering.
- **JavaScript**: Use Web Audio API or third-party libraries like `sox-audio`.
- **Go**: Utilize `go-sox` or implement custom FFT-based noise reduction.
- **.NET**: Use NAudio for audio processing tasks, including filtering noise.
- **Rust**: Use the `dasp` library for audio DSP, including noise reduction.

### Deepgram's Advanced Features

1. **UtteranceEnd and Endpointing**: Utilise features like [UtteranceEnd](./docs/utterance-end) and [Endpointing](./docs/endpointing) to handle pauses and determine when the speaker has finished speaking.

2. **Keyword Boosting**: Implement [Keyword Boosting](./docs/keywords/) to improve the recognition of specific terms that are crucial in your transcripts.

3. **Using Nova 3 Model**: Consider upgrading to the latest Nova 3 model, which offers enhanced capabilities for handling noise.

### Example Code

Here's a basic example of how you might preprocess audio and use Deepgram's API:

```python
import deepgram_sdk
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.silence import split_on_silence

# Load your audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("audio_with_noise.wav")

# Simple noise reduction: split on silence and remove quiet sections
chunks = split_on_silence(audio, silence_thresh=-40)
processed_audio = chunks[0]
for chunk in chunks[1:]:
    processed_audio += chunk

# Convert processed audio to WAV
processed_audio.export("processed_audio.wav", format="wav")

# Initialize Deepgram SDK
deepgram = deepgram_sdk.Deepgram('YOUR_API_KEY')

# Transcribe processed audio
response = deepgram.transcription.prerecorded({
    'url': 'https://path/to/processed_audio.wav',
    'punctuate': True,
    'utterance_end_ms': 1000,
    'keywords': ['specific', 'terms'],
})

print(response)
```

### Error Handling

When integrating, ensure you handle potential errors:

```python
try:
    response = deepgram.transcription.prerecorded(...)
    # Process response
except deepgram_sdk.errors.DeepgramError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Conclusion

Preprocessing your audio for noise reduction, combined with utilising Deepgram's advanced features, can significantly enhance transcription accuracy in noisy environments. Integrate these strategies to ensure effective speech recognition in challenging conditions.

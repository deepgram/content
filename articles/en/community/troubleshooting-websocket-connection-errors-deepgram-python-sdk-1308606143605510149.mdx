<CommunityQuestion>I'm getting a WebSocket connection error when trying to use the Deepgram Python SDK for live transcription. What could be causing this, and how can I fix it?</CommunityQuestion>

When working with Deepgram's Python SDK for live transcription, users may encounter WebSocket connection errors, such as a server-rejected connection with HTTP 400 status codes. These errors can disrupt the transcription process. Here's how to troubleshoot and resolve this issue.

## Understanding the Problem

A WebSocket connection error usually indicates issues with the request sent from the client to Deepgram's servers. This could be attributed to mismatched parameters, incorrect API key usage, or a deprecated SDK version.

## Steps to Resolve

1. **Update the SDK:**
   - Ensure you are using the latest version of the Python SDK. Deepgram's SDK versions update frequently, fixing bugs and improving functionality. Upgrading to the latest version can resolve compatibility issues.
   - You can update the SDK by using the package manager:
     ```bash
     pip install deepgram-sdk --upgrade
     ```

2. **Verify API Key:**
   - Confirm that the API key in your environment variables is valid and has the necessary permissions for transcription.

3. **Correct Parameters:**
   - Ensure all the parameters in the `options` dictionary match Deepgram's documentation for live transcription, specifically match encoding, sample rate, and model specifications.

4. **Check API Endpoint:**
   - Verify that your API endpoint URL is correct. For WebSocket connections, it should be `wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen`.

5. **Network Issues:**
   - Ensure your network configurations allow WebSocket connections and that no firewall settings are blocking the connection.

## Error Handling Example

Here's a simple error handling implementation using the Python SDK:

```python
import websockets
import json
import asyncio

async def main():
    try:
        async with websockets.connect(
            'wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen',
            extra_headers={'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_API_KEY'}
        ) as ws:
            # Send audio data or handle connection
            pass
    except websockets.exceptions.InvalidStatusCode as e:
        print(f"Error: Could not connect to Deepgram! {e.headers.get('dg-error')}")
        print(f"Request ID: {e.headers.get('dg-request-id')}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

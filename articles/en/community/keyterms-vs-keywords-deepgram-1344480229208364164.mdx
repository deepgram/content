<CommunityQuestion>What is the difference between keyterms and keywords in Deepgram's speech-to-text API? I am working on a project that requires accurate recognition of specific terminology, and I am not sure which feature would be more suitable.</CommunityQuestion>

When using Deepgram's speech-to-text API, you may need to improve recognition of specific terms or phrases. Deepgram offers two approaches for this: Keyterms and Keywords. This article explains the differences between these features based on Deepgram's official documentation.

## Keyterms vs Keywords: Key Differences

| Feature | Keyterms | Keywords |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Model Support** | Nova-3 only | Nova-2, Nova, and legacy models |
| **Language Support** | English only | All supported languages |
| **Phrase Support** | Supports multi-word phrases | Limited to single words |
| **Syntax** | Simple: `keyterm=word` | Complex: `keywords=word:boost` |
| **Maximum Tokens** | 500 tokens per request | No specific token limit |

## Keyterm Prompting (Nova-3)

Keyterm Prompting allows you to instantly increase accuracy and recognition of important terminology, including:
- Product and company names
- Industry jargon
- Multi-word phrases
- Uncommon terms

### Implementation

```bash
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3&keyterm=nacho&keyterm=taco+bell'
```

For multi-word keyterms, you can either:
- Use `+` or `%20` to separate words in a single keyterm
- Submit each word as a separate keyterm

## Keywords (Nova-2 and older models)

The Keywords feature helps improve recognition of out-of-vocabulary words or terms that the model might struggle with. Each keyword can have an "intensifier" value from 0 to 10 to adjust how strongly the model should emphasize recognition.

### Implementation

```bash
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-2&keywords=nacho:5&keywords=taco:3'
```

## Best Practices

### For Keyterms (Nova-3)
- Include the entire phrase for multi-word terms
- Limit to 500 tokens per request
- Use for both common and uncommon terms that need improved recognition

### For Keywords (Nova-2)
- Focus on uncommon words the model struggles with
- Avoid boosting common words or alphanumeric sequences
- Submit each word once to avoid redundancy
- Use the intensifier value judiciously (higher isn't always better)

## Migration from Keywords to Keyterms

If you're using Nova-2 with Keywords and plan to migrate to Nova-3:

1. Remove the intensifier values (numbers after colons)
2. Replace `keywords` with `keyterm` in your requests
3. Consider using multi-word phrases where appropriate

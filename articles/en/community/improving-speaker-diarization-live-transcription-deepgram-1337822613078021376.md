# Improving Speaker Diarization in Live Transcription with Deepgram

When using Deepgram's live transcription services, accurately identifying different speakers is essential for many applications, particularly in settings like conference calls or meetings. This guide explains how to optimize speaker diarization for live transcription based on Deepgram's official documentation.

## Understanding Speaker Diarization

Speaker diarization identifies and distinguishes between different speakers in an audio stream. When enabled, Deepgram assigns a speaker identifier to each word in the transcript, helping you track who said what.

For live streaming audio, each word in the transcript includes a `speaker` value when diarization is enabled. Unlike pre-recorded audio, live streaming diarization does not include a `speaker_confidence` value.

## Enabling Diarization

To enable diarization in your live transcription, set the `diarize` parameter to `true` in your API request:

```javascript
const options = {
  model: "nova-3",
  diarize: true,
  language: "en-US",
  smart_format: true,
  interim_results: true
};
```

## Optimizing Diarization Accuracy

To get the best results from speaker diarization in live transcription:

1. **Use the Latest Model**: The `nova-3` model offers improved diarization capabilities.

2. **Enable Smart Formatting**: Set `smart_format: true` to improve transcript readability, which can make speaker changes more apparent.

3. **Consider Audio Quality**: Clear audio with minimal background noise will yield better diarization results.

4. **Speaker Separation**: Ensure speakers are clearly separated in the audio for optimal results.

5. **Tune Endpointing Parameters**: Adjusting `endpointing` (recommended: 300ms) and `utterance_end_ms` (recommended: 1000ms) can help better segment speech by different speakers.

## Example Implementation

Here's a basic implementation using the JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
import { createClient, LiveTranscriptionEvents } from '@deepgram/sdk';

// Initialize the Deepgram client
const deepgram = createClient(YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

// Configure the connection with diarization enabled
const options = {
  model: 'nova-3',
  diarize: true,
  language: 'en-US',
  smart_format: true,
  interim_results: true,
  endpointing: 300,
  utterance_end_ms: 1000
};

// Create a connection
const connection = deepgram.listen.live(options);

// Handle incoming transcripts
connection.addListener(LiveTranscriptionEvents.TRANSCRIPT_RECEIVED, (data) => {
  // Process transcript with speaker information
  if (data.channel && data.channel.alternatives && data.channel.alternatives[0].words) {
    const words = data.channel.alternatives[0].words;
    words.forEach(word => {
      console.log(`Speaker ${word.speaker}: ${word.word}`);
    });
  }
});
```

## Alternative: Consider Multichannel Audio

For scenarios where audio sources can be separated (e.g., different microphones for different speakers), consider using Deepgram's multichannel feature instead of diarization. This approach can yield clearer speaker separation when each speaker has their own audio channel.

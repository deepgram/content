# Upcoming Language Support for Text-to-Speech in Deepgram

Deepgram is actively working on expanding the language support for its text-to-speech (TTS) models. In response to high demand, plans are in place to introduce support for additional languages by 2025. The initial focus will be on adding French and Spanish, with the potential to incorporate more languages as development progresses.

## Language Expansion Plans
Deepgram’s TTS capabilities have been predominantly available in English, but recognizing the diverse needs of its user base, the team is prioritizing French and Spanish for the next wave of language support. These two languages were chosen based on user feedback and demand. 

## Participate in Language Requests
Deepgram values user input and encourages users to participate in shaping future language priorities. If you have specific language needs or preferences, you can contribute by submitting your language requests through the following form: [Deepgram Language Requests](https://deepgram.typeform.com/aura-languages).

## Timeline and Broader Outlook
While French and Spanish are the immediate focus for the forthcoming language support, Deepgram is exploring opportunities to support other widely-used languages. This is part of a broader initiative to make Deepgram’s offerings accessible to a global audience.

Challenges associated with expanding language capabilities include the need for extensive data collection and model training to ensure high-quality text-to-speech outputs. However, the development team is keenly aware of these challenges and is committed to overcoming them.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm trying to use Deepgram's speech-to-text API with Vercel, but my callback URLs are failing due to large payload sizes. How can I manage these payloads and avoid hitting the payload size limit?</CommunityQuestion>

When using Deepgram's transcription services, users may encounter issues with large payloads being sent to callback URLs on platforms like Vercel, where the maximum payload size is limited to 4.5MB. This guide provides strategies to manage and reduce payload sizes effectively.

### Strategies to Manage Payload Size

1. **Chunking Audio Files:**
   
   To handle large audio files, consider chunking them and using Deepgram's streaming service via a Websocket. This method involves sending smaller portions of the audio file, reducing the total payload size sent to your callback URL.

   ```mermaid
   graph TD;
   A[Large Audio File] -->|Chunking| B[Smaller Audio Segments];
   B -->|Stream to Websocket| C[Process Each Segment];
   C -->|Receive Transcripts| D[Consolidate Results];
   D -->|Send Payload| E[Callback URL];
   ```

2. **Customizing Data Sent to Callback:**
   
   By configuring the Deepgram API request, you can filter out unnecessary data. For example, you can choose to receive only the essential transcripts, exclude words, or streamline other parts of the response that you don't need. Reference the [Deepgram API documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com) for response configuration options.

3. **Compression Techniques:**
   
   Although not directly supported by Deepgram, you might consider handling compression on your end. Verify Vercel's compatibility with compressed formats like Gzip for your callback responses, as this could further reduce payload size.

### Exploring Vercel Configurations

While handling payload size through the Deepgram service is one approach, altering Vercel's configuration might provide a more direct solution. You can reach out to Vercel support to inquire about increasing the payload limit on function computation.

If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Discord Community](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

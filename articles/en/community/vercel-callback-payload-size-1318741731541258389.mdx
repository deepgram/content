<CommunityQuestion>I'm trying to use Deepgram's speech-to-text API with Vercel, but my callback URLs are failing due to large payload sizes. How can I manage these payloads and avoid hitting the payload size limit?</CommunityQuestion>

When using Deepgram's transcription services, users may encounter issues with large payloads being sent to callback URLs on platforms like Vercel, where the maximum payload size is limited to 4.5MB. This guide provides strategies to manage and reduce payload sizes effectively.

### Problem Statement

The primary issue is the "413 Request Entity Too Large" error that occurs when payload sizes exceed Vercel's limit. This can disrupt the flow of data between Deepgram's API and your application.

### Strategies to Manage Payload Size

1. **Chunking Audio Files:**
   
   To handle large audio files, consider chunking them and using Deepgram's streaming service via a WebSocket. This method involves sending smaller portions of the audio file, reducing the total payload size sent to your callback URL.

   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');
   const WebSocket = require('ws');

   const audioFile = 'path/to/large_audio_file.wav';
   const CHUNK_SIZE = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB

   fs.open(audioFile, 'r', (err, fd) => {
     if (err) throw err;
     const buffer = Buffer.alloc(CHUNK_SIZE);
     const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen');

     ws.on('open', () => {
       let bytesRead = 0;
       while ((bytesRead = fs.readSync(fd, buffer, 0, CHUNK_SIZE, null)) > 0) {
         ws.send(buffer.slice(0, bytesRead));
       }
       ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'Close' }));
       fs.close(fd, (err) => {
         if (err) throw err;
       });
     });

     ws.on('message', (data) => {
       console.log('Received:', data);
     });

     ws.on('error', (error) => {
       console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
     });
   });
   ```

   For more details, see [WebSocket Streaming with Deepgram](/docs/getting-started-with-live-streaming-audio).

2. **Customising Data Sent to Callback:**
   
   By configuring the Deepgram API request, you can filter out unnecessary data. For example, you can choose to receive only the essential transcripts, exclude words, or streamline other parts of the response that you don't need.

   ```shell
   curl \
     --request POST \
     --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{"url": "https://example.com/audio.mp3", "punctuate": false, "diarize": false}' \
     --url '/v1/listen?callback=YOUR_CALLBACK_URL'
   ```

   Refer to the [Deepgram API Documentation](/docs) for more response configuration options.

3. **Compression Techniques:**
   
   Although not directly supported by Deepgram, you might consider handling compression on your end. Verify Vercel's compatibility with compressed formats like Gzip for your callback responses, as this could further reduce payload size.

### Exploring Vercel Configurations

While handling payload size through the Deepgram service is one approach, altering Vercel's configuration might provide a more direct solution. You can reach out to Vercel support to inquire about increasing the payload limit on function computation.

If issues persist or the system behaviour seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Discord Community](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

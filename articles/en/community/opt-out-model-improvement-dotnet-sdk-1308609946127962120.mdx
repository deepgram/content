<CommunityQuestion>I'm working on a project that involves sensitive data, and I want to ensure that none of the audio is used for improving Deepgram's speech recognition models. How can I opt out of the Model Improvement Program when using the Deepgram SDKs?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

When working with sensitive data, it is essential to ensure that your audio data is not utilised for model improvements by Deepgram. Opting out of the Model Improvement Program (MIP) is critical for maintaining data privacy, but be aware that this will result in an increase in service rates.

## Using Custom Parameters in any SDK

Deepgram SDKs allow you to pass custom parameters to tailor your API requests, including opting out of optional features such as the MIP. To use this feature, include `mip_opt_out=true` as a custom parameter in your API call configuration.

### Example with JavaScript SDK

```javascript
// Install the SDK: npm install @deepgram/sdk
import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";
require('dotenv').config();

const deepgram = createClient(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

const transcribeAudio = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeUrl(
      { url: "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav" },
      { model: "nova-3", mip_opt_out: true }
    );
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error transcribing audio:", error);
  }
};

transcribeAudio();
```

### Example with Python SDK

```python
# Install the SDK: pip install deepgram-sdk
import os
from deepgram import DeepgramClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

API_KEY = os.getenv("DEEPGRAM_API_KEY")
AUDIO_URL = {"url": "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav"}

deepgram = DeepgramClient(API_KEY)

async def transcribe_audio():
    try:
        response = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribe_url(
            AUDIO_URL,
            {"model": "nova-3", "mip_opt_out": True}
        )
        print(response)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error transcribing audio: {e}")

# Ensure the event loop is running
import asyncio
asyncio.run(transcribe_audio())
```

## SDK Documentation

For detailed documentation on how to add custom parameters in Deepgram SDKs, refer to [Using Custom Parameters in SDKs](/docs/using-custom-parameters-sdks).

### Confirming Opt-Out

Once you've opted out, verify this action by checking your usage logs for a price increase, indicating the successful implementation of the `mip_opt_out` parameter.

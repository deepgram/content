<CommunityQuestion>I'm working on a project that involves sensitive data, and I want to ensure that none of the audio is used for improving Deepgram's speech recognition models. How can I opt out of the Model Improvement Program when using the Deepgram SDKs?</CommunityQuestion>

When using Deepgram's transcription services, you might want to opt out of the Model Improvement Program (MIP) due to sensitivity reasons. Keep in mind that opting out will result in an increase in service rates.

## Using Custom Parameters in any SDK

The Deepgram SDKs allows you to pass custom parameters to tailor your API requests as needed, including opting out of optional features such as the MIP.

To use this feature, you need to include `mip_opt_out` as a custom parameter in your API call configuration. This parameter is not explicitly listed in the SDK by default but can be used via the custom parameter mechanism as provided by the SDK.

## SDK Documentation

For detailed documentation on how to add custom parameters in Deepgram SDK, refer to [Deepgram Documentation on Using Custom Parameters in SDKs](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/using-custom-parameters-sdks).

### Confirming Opt-Out

Once you've opted out, you can verify this action by checking your usage logs. Look for a price increase that indicates the successful implementation of the `mip_opt_out` parameter.

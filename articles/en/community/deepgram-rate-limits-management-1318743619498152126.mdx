<CommunityQuestion>I'm developing an app that relies heavily on Deepgram's speech-to-text API, but I've been facing frequent HTTP 429 errors. What's causing this, and how can I manage the rate limits effectively?</CommunityQuestion>

When utilizing Deepgram's API services, it's essential to understand how rate limits may impact your application performance, especially if you're experiencing HHTP 429 errors, which indicate that you've reached the concurrency limits of your plan.

**Understanding Rate Limits**

Deepgram imposes concurrency limits on API requests to ensure fair resource usage across all users. For PayGo plans, the guaranteed limit is 55 concurrent requests, although Deepgram can allow up to 100 requests based on system load. These limits are crucial for maintaining the performance and reliability of the services for all users.

**Assessing Your Usage**

Monitoring and analyzing your request patterns helps in identifying concurrency peaks over time. Review your API logs to observe the maximum number of concurrent requests on a daily basis. This data can provide valuable insights into whether you are consistently hitting or approaching the rate limits.

Here's an example log summary:

| Date (UTC)       | Max Concurrent Requests |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| 2024-12-06       | 36                      |
| 2024-12-07       | 26                      |
| 2024-12-08       | 36                      |
| 2024-12-09       | 92                      |
| 2024-12-10       | 63                      |
| 2024-12-11       | 36                      |
| 2024-12-12       | 30                      |
| 2024-12-13       | 33                      |

**Implementing Rate Limiting Strategies**

To mitigate the risk of hitting concurrency limits and encountering 429 errors, consider implementing a rate limiting strategy or a back-off mechanism in your application:

1. **Back-off Strategy**: Automatically throttle your requests when nearing concurrency limits. This can prevent spikes that may lead to rate limiting.
2. **Rate Limiting Middleware**: Deploy middleware within your application to pace the request sending rate.
3. **Queue Requests**: Manage request flow by queuing requests and processing based on current system capacity.

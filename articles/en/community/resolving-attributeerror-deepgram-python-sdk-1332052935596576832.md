# Resolving AttributeError in Deepgram's Python SDK

When using Deepgram's Python SDK for speech-to-text services, particularly with nova-2 models and deepgram-sdk version 3, some users may encounter an error message: `'ListenClient' object has no attribute 'rest'`. This article will guide you through resolving this issue to ensure smooth integration and use of Deepgram's services.

## Understanding the Error

The error `'ListenClient' object has no attribute 'rest'` typically occurs when there is an attempt to call a non-existent attribute or method within an object. In the context of Deepgram's SDK, it might mean that the instance of the `ListenClient` class is being incorrectly engaged with methods or attributes that aren't part of its current release or require updates.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Update to the Latest SDK Version**: It's advisable to use the latest version of the Deepgram Python SDK. As of the latest update, the recommended version is [v3.8.0](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/releases/tag/v3.8.0). Updating to the newest version often resolves these types of errors by incorporating the latest functionality and bug fixes.

```bash
pip install --upgrade deepgram-sdk
```

2. **Refer to Updated Documentation**: Ensure that you refer to the official [Deepgram Python SDK documentation](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk) to confirm the correct usage patterns and method calls that are to be employed.

## Conclusion

By updating to the latest version of the Deepgram Python SDK and ensuring alignment with current documentation, you can effectively correct the "no attribute 'rest'" error and leverage Deepgram's advanced speech-to-text capabilities.

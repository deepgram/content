# Deepgram Audio Intelligence: Compatibility with European Languages

Deepgram currently offers advanced Audio Intelligence features which enhance transcription analysis, primarily available for English language audio files. These features provide deeper insights into audio content, utilizing numerous contextual, structural, and emotional analytics to refine transcription accuracy and usability.

### Current Language Support

At this time, Deepgram’s Audio Intelligence features are restricted to English audio content. Users working with audio files in European languages such as Spanish, French, German, etc., will not have access to the full suite of Audio Intelligence capabilities. This limitation is due to the complex nature of processing diverse linguistic, syntactic, and semantic elements present in different languages. Consequently, while transcriptions for many other languages are supported, the enhanced analytics derived from Audio Intelligence remain exclusive to English.

### Solution and Alternatives

While the direct application of Audio Intelligence features for European languages is not available, users can still effectively utilize Deepgram’s standard transcription services for these languages. These services offer high accuracy and integration capabilities through the [Deepgram API](https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen), enabling efficient handling of non-English audio files.

For those seeking advanced analytic features in non-English languages, external tools or custom-built solutions may be needed to complement Deepgram’s transcription services. These tools could include language-specific natural language processing (NLP) libraries or bespoke algorithms developed based on the specific requirements of the audio content analysis.

### Looking Forward

Improvements and expansion of Deepgram’s capabilities are ongoing. Although a definitive timeline cannot be provided, the company continues to explore broader language support for advanced audio analytics. Users are encouraged to stay connected with Deepgram’s community platforms, such as [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram), for updates and feature releases.

### Conclusion

Deepgram remains committed to enhancing its linguistic offerings, and ongoing efforts may bring expanded audio intelligence for other languages in the future.

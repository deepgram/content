# Troubleshooting Deepgram ListenWebSocketClient Message Issues

When experiencing an issue where no messages are received after connecting and sending audio data using the Deepgram ListenWebSocketClient, there are a few steps and configurations to consider. 

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Query Parameters:**
   Ensure that the `encoding` and `sample_rate` are set correctly in your query parameters when establishing a connection to the Deepgram API. Without these parameters, Deepgram will not process your audio data correctly. 

   Example of correct parameters:
   ```plaintext
   encoding=mulaw&sample_rate=8000
   ```

2. **Validate Audio Data:**
   Confirm that the audio data being sent is valid and properly formatted. Deepgram logs indicate errors when non-audio files are sent.

   - Verify that the audio data adheres to the expected format such as 160-byte mulaw packets.
   - If converting audio from services like Twilio, ensure the format conversion is valid and compatible with Deepgram's requirements.

3. **Review Logs for Errors:**
   Use generated logs to identify specific issues. Deepgram's logs will often provide error messages and suggest what needs correction if the audio data is improperly configured or encoded.

   Example log messages:
   - `Raw binary data was sent to Deepgram without both the encoding and sample_rate set.`
   - `A non-audio file was sent to Deepgram.`

4. **Ensure Connection and Subscriptions:**
   Double-check that your WebSocket client is properly subscribing to events such as `Open`, `MessageReceived`, `BinaryReceived`, and `Closed`. Ensure your callbacks and event listeners are correctly implemented to handle these events.

5. **Test with Known Good Data:**
   It may also be helpful to test with a set of known good data or a baseline example that works correctly with Deepgram, to isolate whether the issue is with the incoming audio or the client configuration.

## Example Configuration

In the context of coding SDKs, such as the C# SDK:

- Make sure your implementation correctly processes events.
- Logs are essential; enable debugging and logging to get more insights into what might be going wrong.
  
### C# Client Configuration 

Although specific coding details can vary depending on the language used, the general principle is ensuring your SDK client correctly instantiates and sends data following Deepgram's guidelines. For C# users, explore the [Deepgram .NET SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk) for specific examples and further reference.

## Conclusion

By addressing the above areas, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve issues related to receiving messages in the Deepgram ListenWebSocketClient. If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Community](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

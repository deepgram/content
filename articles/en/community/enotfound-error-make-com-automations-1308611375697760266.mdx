<CommunityQuestion>I've been having issues with my Make.com automations failing due to an 'ENOTFOUND' error. Does anyone know how to resolve this frustrating problem?</CommunityQuestion>

## Understanding the "ENOTFOUND" Error

The "ENOTFOUND" error typically indicates that a service being referenced cannot be found or is temporarily unavailable. Common causes include:

- **Network Connectivity Issues:** Check your internet connection. Interruptions could prevent the automation from communicating with the necessary endpoints.
- **Service Outage:** Verify if the service you are attempting to connect to is experiencing downtime or maintenance.
- **Incorrect Configuration:** Double-check any service endpoints, API keys, or authentication details within your automation setup.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Service Status:**
   - Confirm whether there is an outage on Deepgram's end by visiting our [status page](https://status.deepgram.com/). It's important to ensure that our services are operational.

2. **Review Connectivity:**
   - Ensure your network connection is stable. You may want to attempt running the automation again to see if the error persists.

3. **Validate Inputs:**
   - Revisit your automation setup in Make.com. Ensure any URLs, endpoints, or authentication tokens (e.g., UUIDs) are correctly configured and valid.
   - Use the [Deepgram API documentation](/reference/api) to verify that all configurations align with expected parameters.

4. **Consult Community Forums:**
   - If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the wider community for insights. The [Deepgram GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions) and our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/deepgram) are valuable resources for support and guidance from fellow users and our team.

## Example Error Message

A typical "ENOTFOUND" error message might look like this:

```
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND api.deepgram.com
```

This message indicates that the hostname could not be resolved, often due to network or configuration issues.

## Alternative Solutions

- **Implement Error Handling:** Consider adding error handling within your Make.com automation to retry connections or provide alternative pathways if a service is temporarily unavailable.
- **Use KeepAlive Messages:** For WebSocket connections, regularly send KeepAlive messages to maintain connections and avoid timeouts. See our [KeepAlive documentation](/docs/keep-alive) for guidance.

## Conclusion

The "ENOTFOUND" error in Make.com automations can usually be traced to network issues, service outages, or configuration mistakes. By systematically reviewing these areas, users can often resolve the issue swiftly. For persistent issues, engaging with our community forums can provide additional troubleshooting insights and support.

<CommunityQuestion>I've been having trouble with Deepgram's speech-to-text API as some of my requests are getting rejected by AWS WAF. How can I resolve this issue and ensure my requests go through smoothly?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

When using Deepgram's transcription services, requests may be blocked by AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) due to missing User-Agent headers. This issue can prevent Deepgram from accessing audio files required for transcription.

## Potential Impact

AWS WAF may reject HTTP requests lacking a User-Agent header as a security measure against bot traffic. This can impede Deepgram's ability to fetch audio resources from URLs, impacting the transcription process.

## Addressing the Issue

Here are recommended strategies to resolve this problem:

1. **Update AWS WAF Rules:**
   Adjust your AWS WAF settings to allow requests from Deepgram. Consider adding rules that permit requests based on identifiers like the `dg-token` header.

   ```shell
   # Example AWS CLI command to update WAF rules
   aws wafv2 update-web-acl --name "YourWAFName" --scope REGIONAL \
   --default-action Allow --rules file://rules.json
   ```

   Ensure your `rules.json` includes logic to allow requests from Deepgram based on specific headers or IP addresses.

2. **Validate Requests:**
   Authenticate incoming requests using Deepgram's `dg-token` header. This approach helps verify that requests are legitimate and should be allowed by your firewall.

   ```json
   {
     "headers": {
       "dg-token": "your_valid_token"
     }
   }
   ```

## Error Handling

If a request is blocked, you might encounter an error message indicating the rejection. Ensure your application logs these errors for troubleshooting. Here's a basic example of handling such errors in a Node.js environment:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://your-audio-url.com', {
  headers: {
    'User-Agent': 'YourAppName',
    'dg-token': 'your_valid_token'
  }
}).catch(error => {
  if (error.response) {
    console.error('Error:', error.response.status, error.response.data);
  } else {
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
  }
});
```

## Recommendations for Developers

Although Deepgram's API doesn't currently allow sending arbitrary headers, adjusting WAF rules or using provided headers can help ensure requests are not blocked. If problems persist, consider more context-aware firewall rules, specifically targeting Deepgram's domain or expected headers.

## Conclusion

Integrating Deepgram's services with AWS WAF requires careful configuration to align security protocols with operational needs. Adjusting firewall settings to accommodate necessary headers can help maintain seamless API interactions.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm a developer working on a healthcare app that needs to integrate real-time transcription for clinical notes. Could someone explain how I can get started with Deepgram's medical speech-to-text model and provide a brief overview of the process?</CommunityQuestion>

Explore how to start building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using Deepgram's Nova-3 Medical model for enhancing clinical documentation in real-time settings. This guide will walk you through the necessary procedures and resources to effectively utilise Deepgram's API for medical transcription.

## Understanding Deepgram’s Nova-3 Model
Deepgram's **Nova-3 Medical model** focuses on delivering low word error rates with specific enhancements for medical terminology through real-time transcription. Utilise this model to improve clinical documentation workflows by automatically transcribing audio to text.

### API Credentials
- **Create an Account**: Visit Deepgram and [sign up](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys) to create a free account. New users have access to $200 worth of services.
- **API Key**: Generate your [API Key](https://developers.deepgram.com/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key) once account registration is complete.

### Model Syntax
For leveraging the Nova-3 Medical model, make requests with this specific query:
```shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3-medical"
```
Ensure you replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. For more details, refer to [Deepgram API Overview](/reference/deepgram-api-overview).

## Steps to Get Started

1. **Leverage the Deepgram Console**:
   - Navigate to 'Demo: Transcribe' under the Deepgram Console to test live transcription using Nova-3 Medical without any preliminary coding.

2. **Explore Deepgram's SDKs**:
   - Choose your preferred programming language and utilise Deepgram’s SDKs to integrate the API into your platform:
     - Python [Deepgram SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk)
     - Node.js [Deepgram SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk)
     - .NET [Deepgram SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk)
     - Rust [Deepgram SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-rust-sdk)
     - Go [Deepgram SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk)

3. **Use Case Exploration**:
   - Examine various [use case examples](https://developers.deepgram.com/use-cases/) to understand real-world applications of Deepgram’s transcription capabilities.

4. **Hands-on Experience with Code Samples**:
   - Access a library of code samples on Deepgram’s [GitHub repo](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/code-samples) to see practical implementations.

## Example: Error Handling in API Requests
When integrating the API, ensure to incorporate error handling to manage potential issues effectively:
```python
import requests

def transcribe_audio(api_key, audio_url):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Token {api_key}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    response = requests.post(
        f"https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3-medical",
        headers=headers,
        json={"url": audio_url}
    )
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.json()}")
    else:
        print("Transcription successful:", response.json())

# Example usage
transcribe_audio("YOUR_API_KEY", "https://example.com/audio.mp3")
```
This example demonstrates basic error handling by checking the response status code and printing an error message if the request fails.

## Conclusion
Deepgram’s Nova-3 Medical model is exceptionally robust for delivering precise, real-time transcription tailored for medical settings. Whether you’re starting from scratch or enhancing an existing system, this guide should empower you with the needed resources and steps.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm working on a healthcare application that needs to transcribe medical consultations in multiple languages. Does Deepgram's speech-to-text API support this functionality, or do I need to look elsewhere?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

Transcribing medical consultations in multiple languages presents unique challenges, including the need for accurate recognition of specialised medical terminology and support for diverse languages. This article addresses these challenges by exploring the multi-language support of Deepgram's medical models.

## Current Language Support for Medical Models

According to Deepgram's documentation, the current language support for medical models is as follows:

- **Nova-3 Medical**: English only (`en`, `en-US`)
- **Nova-2 Medical**: English only (`en`, `en-US`)

This means that at present, Deepgram's specialised medical models are optimised for English language medical terminology and transcription.

## Multi-language Support in General Models

While the medical-specific models currently support only English, Deepgram's general models offer extensive multi-language capabilities:

- **Nova-3**: Supports multilingual transcription with 10 languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Russian, Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, and Dutch) and includes multilingual code-switching capability.
- **Nova-2**: Supports over 40 languages and dialects, with multilingual code-switching between Spanish and English.

## Options for Non-English Medical Transcription

For organisations requiring medical transcription in languages other than English, consider these approaches:

1. **Use Nova-3 General Model**: For languages supported by Nova-3, this model offers excellent general transcription that may be sufficient for many medical contexts.

   ```shell
   curl \
     --request POST \
     --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY' \
     --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
     --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
     --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3-general&language=es'
   ```

2. **Custom Vocabulary**: Utilise Deepgram's custom vocabulary and keyterm features to enhance recognition of medical terminology in non-English languages.

   ```javascript
   const axios = require('axios');

   async function transcribeAudio() {
     try {
       const response = await axios.post('https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen', {
         headers: {
           'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_API_KEY',
           'Content-Type': 'audio/wav',
         },
         params: {
           model: 'nova-3-general',
           language: 'de',
           keyterms: 'cardiology, oncology, neurology'
         },
         data: 'youraudio.wav'
       });
       console.log(response.data);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error transcribing audio:', error.response.data);
     }
   }

   transcribeAudio();
   ```

3. **Feature Requests**: If your organisation has specific language needs for medical transcription, Deepgram welcomes feedback and feature requests to inform future development.

## Future Developments

Deepgram continues to expand language support across its model lineup. While specific timelines for additional language support in medical models aren't publicly announced, Deepgram's roadmap includes ongoing improvements to both language coverage and domain-specific capabilities.

## Conclusion

For English medical transcription, Deepgram's specialised medical models offer optimised performance. For other languages, the general Nova-3 or Nova-2 models provide robust multi-language support that can be enhanced with custom vocabulary for medical terminology.

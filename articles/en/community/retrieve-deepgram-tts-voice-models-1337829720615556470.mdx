<CommunityQuestion>I'm building an app that requires different text-to-speech voices, but I'm unsure how to access the available voice models provided by Deepgram's API. Could someone explain the process?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

For developers looking to integrate Deepgram's text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities within applications, it's essential to programmatically list all available voice models. This capability allows developers to select the most appropriate voices for their application's needs.

## Retrieving Voice Models with Deepgram API

Deepgram provides API endpoints to access information about available TTS voice models. Here’s how you can retrieve these models:

### API Endpoints

1. **Public Models Endpoint**
   - Endpoint: `/v1/models/tts/public`
   - Use this endpoint to fetch metadata about all the latest public voice models available through Deepgram. This is ideal for applications targeting a general audience.

2. **Project-Specific Models Endpoint**
   - Endpoint: `/v1/models/tts/project`
   - This endpoint is used to retrieve metadata for all voice models available to your specific project, including any private models.

### Authentication and Headers

To access these endpoints, you need to include your Deepgram API key in the request header. Ensure your API key is kept secure and never hard-coded in your application.

**Headers Example:**

```shell
Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Sample Code Example

Below is a sample `cURL` command demonstrating how to retrieve the available TTS voice models:

```shell
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.deepgram.com/v1/models/tts/public \
     --header "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Error Handling

Ensure to handle errors gracefully. Here’s an example of how to include error handling in your request:

```shell
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.deepgram.com/v1/models/tts/public \
     --header "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --silent \
     --fail \
     --output models.json || echo "Failed to retrieve models"
```

### Response Structure

The response from these endpoints includes a `tts` array with model metadata. Here's a sample structure:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "angus",
      "canonical_name": "aura-angus-en",
      "languages": ["en", "en-IE"],
      "version": "2024-11-19.0",
      "metadata": {
        "accent": "Irish",
        "sample": "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/voices/angus.wav"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Integration

To integrate this functionality:

- Perform a GET request to the endpoint that suits your needs.
- Parse the JSON response to dynamically display or implement model selection within your application.

**Note:** Always ensure your application handles API responses and potential errors appropriately.

## Conclusion

By leveraging these endpoints, developers can offer dynamic voice model selection options within their applications, thus tailoring TTS experiences to user needs.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm working on a project that requires using Deepgram's Voice Agent to generate Portuguese speech with Cartesia's TTS. Could someone explain how to properly configure the settings to achieve this?</CommunityQuestion>

To configure Deepgram's Voice Agent to speak Portuguese using Cartesia's TTS, you need to adjust the settings properly to ensure the correct language output. This article outlines the necessary configuration steps and addresses potential issues related to setting up the Cartesia TTS provider with a specific language.

## Configuration Steps

To use Cartesia as your TTS provider within Deepgram's Voice Agent, you must set the `speak` model configuration correctly. Here is an example of what your configuration might look like:

```json
{
  "type": "SettingsConfiguration",
  "audio": {
    "input": {
      "encoding": "mulaw",
      "sample_rate": 8000
    },
    "output": {
      "encoding": "mulaw",
      "sample_rate": 8000,
      "container": "none"
    }
  },
  "agent": {
    "listen": {
      "model": "nova-3"
    },
    "think": {
      "provider": {
        "type": "open_ai"
      },
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
    },
    "speak": {
      "provider": "cartesia",
      "voice_id": "<your_voice_id>",
      "language": "pt-PT"
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding Language Specification

When using Cartesia, it's important to specify the language to prevent defaulting to English with an accent. In the configuration above, the `"language": "pt-PT"` line specifies Portuguese.

### Error Handling

Ensure your application includes error handling to manage any configuration issues or connectivity problems. For example:

```python
try:
    # Your code to connect with Deepgram's Voice Agent
    # Apply the configuration settings
    pass
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Conclusion

As of recent updates, Deepgram supports specifying language in the Voice Agent Settings Configuration, simplifying TTS configuration with third-party providers like Cartesia.

Keep your configuration files updated and consult [Cartesia documentation](https://docs.cartesia.ai/get-started/overview) for advanced features and settings. If issues persist, reach out to your Deepgram support representative or visit our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram) for assistance.

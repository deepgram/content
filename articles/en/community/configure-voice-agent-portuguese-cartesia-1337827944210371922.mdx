<CommunityQuestion>I'm working on a project that requires using Deepgram's Voice Agent to generate Portuguese speech with Cartesia's TTS. Could someone explain how to properly configure the settings to achieve this?</CommunityQuestion>

To configure Deepgram's Voice Agent to speak Portuguese using Cartesia's TTS, you need to adjust the settings properly to ensure the correct language output. This article outlines the necessary configuration steps and addresses potential issues related to setting up the Cartesia TTS provider with a specific language.

## Configuration Steps

To use Cartesia as your TTS provider within Deepgram's Voice Agent, you must set the `speak` model configuration correctly. Here is an example of what your configuration might look like:

```json
{
  "type": "SettingsConfiguration",
  "audio": {
    "input": {
      "encoding": "mulaw",
      "sample_rate": 8000
    },
    "output": {
      "encoding": "mulaw",
      "sample_rate": 8000,
      "container": "none"
    }
  },
  "agent": {
    "listen": {
      "model": "nova-2"
    },
    "think": {
      "provider": {
        "type": "open_ai"
      },
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
    },
    "speak": {
      "provider": "cartesia",
      "voice_id": "<your_voice_id>"
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding Language Specification

When using Cartesia, it's important to specify the language to prevent defaulting to English with an accent:

## Conclusion

As of recent updates, Deepgram might allow specifying language in the Voice Agent Settings Config, simplifying TTS configuration with third-party providers like Cartesia.

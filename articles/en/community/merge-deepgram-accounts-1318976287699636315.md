# How to Merge Deepgram Accounts with Different API Keys and Balances

If you've accidentally created two Deepgram accounts using the same email through different sign-up methods (e.g., email and GitHub) and now have separate balances and API keys, you might want to merge them for convenience. This guide will provide the steps you need to take to have your accounts merged effectively.

### Steps to Merge Accounts

1. **Identify the Accounts**: Identify your main account (the one with the API keys and balance you actively use) and the secondary account.

2. **Gather Project IDs**: For both accounts, you'll need to gather the Project IDs. Here's how you can find them:
   - Navigate to the Deepgram dashboard.
   - In the top left corner, you'll find a project selector. Click on it and note down the Project ID for each account.

3. **Contact Support**: Reach out to Deepgram support through email or the community channels with the following information:
   - Project IDs for both the main and secondary accounts.
   - A clear request to merge the accounts, specifying which account you want to retain.
   - Mention any discrepancies such as differences in balances or API keys.

4. **Email Support**: Send an email to `devrel@deepgram.com` including:
   - The gathered details (Project IDs, etc.).
   - A link to any relevant discussion thread on community platforms like Discord if applicable.
   - Make sure the email is sent from the address you used to sign up for Deepgram.

   Example Email:
   ```
   Subject: Merge Account Request

   Hello Deepgram Support,

   I have two accounts associated with the same email: one created with email and another with GitHub. Here are the details:
   - Main Account Project ID: XXXXXX
   - Secondary Account Project ID: XXXXXX

   Could you please assist in merging these, retaining the main account with its API keys and balance?

   Thank you,
   [Your Name]
   ```

<CommunityQuestion>I'm using the Deepgram Speech-to-Text API with WebSockets, but I keep getting an error saying 'no close frame received or sent'. How can I resolve this issue?</CommunityQuestion>

When working with Deepgram's Speech-to-Text (STT) API, you might encounter the error "no close frame received or sent." This issue often arises when using WebSockets, particularly with streaming or live transcription services. Ensuring a stable connection and appropriately managing application logic can help resolve this issue.

### Understanding the Error

The "no close frame received or sent" message typically indicates that a WebSocket connection was terminated without the expected close handshake. WebSockets are designed to maintain persistent connections, which require proper opening and closing sequences. A missing close frame suggests an abrupt disconnection, either from the client-side or external factors like network instability.

### Common Causes and Solutions

1. **Improper Connection Handling:**
   - Ensure your WebSocket implementation correctly handles the opening and closing of connections.
   - Upon completion of data transmission, always call the `close()` method on your WebSocket object to gracefully terminate the connection.

   ```javascript
   const WebSocket = require('ws');
   const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen', {
       headers: {
           Authorization: 'Token YOUR_API_KEY',
       }
   });

   ws.on('open', () => {
       console.log('WebSocket connection established.');
       // Send audio data...
   });

   ws.on('close', () => {
       console.log('WebSocket connection closed.');
   });

   ws.on('error', (error) => {
       console.error('WebSocket error:', error.message);
   });

   // Close the WebSocket connection gracefully
   function closeWebSocket() {
       ws.close();
   }
   ```

2. **Network Instability:**
   - Check your internet connection's stability. Unstable networks can interrupt WebSocket communications.
   - Consider implementing reconnection logic in case the connection is dropped unexpectedly.

3. **Proxy or Firewall Restrictions:**
   - Ensure any proxy servers or firewalls in use do not block or limit WebSocket connections.
   - Review the configurations to allow steady WebSocket traffic.

4. **SDK and Libraries:**
   - If using an SDK, make sure itâ€™s up to date. Older SDKs might not handle certain connection scenarios optimally.
   - Review the [Deepgram SDKs Documentation](../docs/deepgram-sdks) for more details.

### Specific Error Codes

- **`1011` - `NET-0000`**: Indicates that Deepgram wasn't able to generate a transcript for the audio data before the system timed out. Check [Deepgram's Status](https://status.deepgram.com/) or contact support if the systems are operational.
- **`1011` - `NET-0001`**: Occurs when Deepgram didn't receive any audio before timing out. Ensure audio is sent within 10 seconds of opening the WebSocket.

### Alternative Solution: REST API

For those encountering persistent issues with WebSockets, transitioning to Deepgram's REST API for pre-recorded audio might be a viable solution. While it may not suit live needs, for many applications, the REST API provides a stable alternative without the complications of managing a WebSocket connection.

### Conclusion

Following the practices above can mitigate the "no close frame received or sent" error. Proper connection handling, checking network status, configuring security tools, and ensuring SDK updates are key to maintaining uninterrupted service.

If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Community](../community)

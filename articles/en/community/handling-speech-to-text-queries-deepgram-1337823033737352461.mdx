<CommunityQuestion>I'm building a voice assistant app and need to transcribe audio recordings of user queries. What's the best way to integrate Deepgram's speech-to-text API for handling pre-recorded audio files?</CommunityQuestion>

Deepgram offers powerful speech-to-text capabilities, accessible through our various API endpoints and SDKs. Ensuring effective use of these resources can speed up handling of queries related to speech-to-text transcription, live streaming, and text analysis. This guide illustrates standard practices when working with our systems.

## Using Deepgram's Speech-to-Text API

### Overview of the API

Deepgram's speech-to-text service is accessed through its API endpoint for pre-recorded audio: `https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen`. You can find a detailed guide to getting started with transcription on our [developers' website](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/getting-started-with-pre-recorded-audio).

For live audio streaming, the API endpoint is `wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen`. Visit the [live streaming audio documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/getting-started-with-live-streaming-audio) for comprehensive instructions on using this feature.

### Common Libraries and Tools

Several SDKs make integrating Deepgram into your projects more straightforward. See the respective GitHub repositories for setup instructions and example usage:

- [JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk)
- [Go SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk)
- [.NET SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk)
- [Rust SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-rust-sdk)

## Best Practices for Handling Requests

### Debugging and Problem-solving

When issues arise, check for common problems such as incorrect API keys, mismatched endpoint usage, or incorrect configuration settings.

If problems persist, gather details including error messages and request IDs. This information will be crucial if you need to escalate the issue for more support.

### Source Control and Collaboration

If you're touching on open-source projects or public platforms like GitHub Discussions, ensure your contributions are clear and well-documented. Providing links to relevant documentation and keeping the conversation focused can enhance collaboration.

### Support

If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Community Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

## Conclusion

Deepgram provides a comprehensive suite of APIs and SDKs to facilitate seamless speech-to-text integration. Utilize our detailed documentation and community tools to optimize your workflow and tackle any issues efficiently.

# Multi-language Support in Medical Models

In the fast-evolving landscape of speech-to-text technologies, multi-language support is a valuable feature, especially in specialized applications such as medical transcription. Deepgram's Nova-2 model already provides extensive multi-language capabilities for general transcription tasks, making it an attractive choice for diverse global users.

However, when it comes to specialized models like Nova-2 Medical, users often query if there are plans to integrate similar multi-language functionalities. While specifics can't be provided at this moment concerning the timeline or development roadmap for additional language support in Nova-2 Medical, it is confirmed that Deepgram is committed to expanding the language capabilities of all its models. This initiative aims to accommodate the growing demand across various industries, including the medical sector.

### The Difference a Multi-language Model Makes
Multi-language models can drastically ease communication barriers in international medical settings, enhancing both understanding and patient care. By enabling support for multiple languages, medical transcription can be accessible to a broader audience, accommodating practitioners and patients fluent in different tongues.

### Future of Language Support
Deepgram continuously seeks to enhance its offerings and strives to extend language compatibility where feasible. Users interested in specific languages or searing immediate solutions may consider combining the general model's current multi-language support with medical vocabulary lists tailored to their needs.

If enhancements in language support are critical to your requirements, feedback from users plays a significant role in shaping future capabilities. Always feel free to contribute your suggestions through our community forums.

### Conclusion
Though precise timelines are unavailable, rest assured that multi-language support remains a key area of focus. Deepgram's dedication to evolving its models to meet user needs reflects its commitment to excellence in the field of automatic speech recognition.

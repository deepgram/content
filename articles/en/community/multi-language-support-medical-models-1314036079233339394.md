# Multi-language Support in Deepgram's Medical Models

Speech-to-text technology for healthcare applications requires both specialized medical terminology recognition and support for diverse languages. This article provides accurate information about multi-language support in Deepgram's medical models, based on the official documentation.

## Current Language Support for Medical Models

According to Deepgram's documentation, the current language support for medical models is as follows:

- **Nova-3 Medical**: English only (`en`, `en-US`)
- **Nova-2 Medical**: English only (`en`, `en-US`)

This means that at present, Deepgram's specialized medical models are optimized for English language medical terminology and transcription.

## Multi-language Support in General Models

While the medical-specific models currently support only English, Deepgram's general models offer extensive multi-language capabilities:

- **Nova-3**: Supports multilingual transcription with 10 languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Russian, Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, and Dutch) and includes multilingual codeswitching capability
- **Nova-2**: Supports over 40 languages and dialects, with multilingual codeswitching between Spanish and English

## Options for Non-English Medical Transcription

For organizations requiring medical transcription in languages other than English, there are several approaches to consider:

1. **Use Nova-3 General Model**: For languages supported by Nova-3, this model offers excellent general transcription that may be sufficient for many medical contexts.

2. **Custom Vocabulary**: Utilize Deepgram's custom vocabulary and keyterm features to enhance recognition of medical terminology in non-English languages.

3. **Feature Requests**: If your organization has specific language needs for medical transcription, Deepgram welcomes feedback and feature requests to inform future development.

## Future Developments

Deepgram continues to expand language support across its model lineup. While specific timelines for additional language support in medical models aren't publicly announced, Deepgram's roadmap includes ongoing improvements to both language coverage and domain-specific capabilities.

## Conclusion

For English medical transcription, Deepgram's specialized medical models offer optimized performance. For other languages, the general Nova-3 or Nova-2 models provide robust multi-language support that can be enhanced with custom vocabulary for medical terminology.

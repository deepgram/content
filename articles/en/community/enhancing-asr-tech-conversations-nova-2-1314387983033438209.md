# Enhancing ASR for Tech Conversations with Deepgram's Nova-2

For those navigating automated speech recognition (ASR) challenges in tech-related conversations, especially around software development, Deepgram offers advanced solutions, though not specifically tailored to this niche. Our latest ASR model, Nova-2, is particularly adept at handling various domains, and it may enhance clarity in such dialogues. 

## Utilization of Deepgram's STT Models

Deepgram provides several speech-to-text (STT) models, each designed for specific applications. While we lack a model explicitly fine-tuned for software development discussions, Nova-2 is highly adaptable and may improve recognition accuracy in this context.

### Nova-2 Model
Nova-2 stands out due to its enhanced ability to process natural speech effectively. To optimize ASR performance with Nova-2:
- Ensure clear enunciation when speaking.
- Minimize background noise and muffling in audio inputs. 

### Leveraging Keyword Input
In scenarios where domain-specific language is prevalent, like tech and software talks, utilizing keywords can significantly aid transcription accuracy. By feeding relevant keywords into the ASR system, users guide the model to better recognize and transcribe domain-specific terms.

- **Using Keywords**: Keywords assist the system in identifying and prioritizing specific words or phrases related to your domain, which is crucial in technical discussions where jargon and specific terms are common.

Refer to our [keywords documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/keywords) for guidance on integrating this feature effectively.

If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: https://discord.gg/deepgram

## Conclusion
While Deepgram's offerings do not currently include a model exclusively for software development discourse, enhancements through Nova-2 and the strategic use of keywords provide viable solutions for improving ASR accuracy in tech conversations.

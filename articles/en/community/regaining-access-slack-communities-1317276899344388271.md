# Regaining Access to Slack Communities After Trial Expiration

When access to a specific Slack community is lost due to the expiration of a premium trial, there are several steps to regain entry. Whether you're dealing with a startup program chat or specific channels within the Deepgram community, the process of re-entry requires coordination with community administrators or support.

### Steps to Regain Access to a Slack Community
1. **Identify the Email Addresses**: Ensure you have the email addresses used to originally join the Slack community.

2. **Contact Community Administrators**: Reach out to the community administrators or support staff, indicating the issue of lost access due to trial expiration.

3. **Request Reinvitation**: Request to be reinvited to the community or specific channels. Include necessary details like the email addresses that require the invites.

4. **Accept the New Invite**: Once the administrator sends a new invitation, you need to accept and complete any necessary login steps.

5. **Access as a Single Channel Guest**: In certain cases, administrators may add users back as single-channel guests as a possible solution if full access isn't suitable or feasible at that moment.

### Conclusion
Regaining access to Slack communities after the end of a trial requires proactive communication with community administrators. By having your details ready and maintaining clear communication, re-entry can often be quickly arranged.

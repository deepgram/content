<CommunityQuestion>I'm building a voice assistant and want it to avoid interrupting itself when a user speaks during its output. How can I achieve user-only interruptions with Deepgram's speech-to-text API?</CommunityQuestion>

Building a voicebot that can listen to user interruptions without interrupting itself can be a challenging task. The challenge primarily lies in the fact that the microphone is always on, leading to situations where the bot might inadvertently interrupt itself. Here, we discuss strategies for effectively managing this, focusing on implementations with Python.

## Managing Voicebot Interruptions

When developing a voicebot that listens continually, it's essential to differentiate between the bot's own voice and the user's voice. The goal is to ensure the bot processes interruptions selectively based on user input.

### Key Strategies

1. **Voice Detection and Filtering**
   - Implement algorithms to distinguish between audio input from the user and echoes or feedback from the bot's own voice.
   - Use signal processing techniques to filter out the bot's voice when it's speaking, allowing only user-generated sound to trigger the voicebot's interrupt functions.

2. **Microphone Management**
   - Control the microphone's state programmatically. For example, mute the microphone when the bot is speaking and unmute only when user input is expected.

3. **Using Frameworks and Libraries**
   - Leverage pre-built functionalities in frameworks such as Deepgram's Voice Agent API, which provides comprehensive features for handling voice interactions more smoothly.

4. **Feedback Suppression**
   - Employ feedback suppression techniques to manage and minimize the feedback loop caused by the botâ€™s own output being picked up by the microphone.

## Example Implementation

A practical example of managing such scenarios can be seen in our [Flask Agent Function Calling Demo](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/flask-agent-function-calling-demo). This demo demonstrates how to set up a voicebot using a browser microphone designed to prevent self-interruption. 

### Key Function: `start_microphone`

- The `start_microphone` function is pivotal as it's designed to manage the recording session within a browser, handling audio input efficiently to focus solely on user interactions.
- You can view its implementation [here](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/flask-agent-function-calling-demo/blob/6d35357a859f3c0876d4007fd56c0f2a0d5b486a/client.py#L205).

### Additional Resources

For further guidance, Deepgram's documentation on [voice-agent-audio-playback](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/voice-agent-audio-playback#the-agent-voice-is-triggering-itself) provides valuable insights into mitigating self-triggering issues.

## Conclusion

Implementing a voicebot that effectively differentiates between user voice and self-output requires a combination of technical strategies and thoughtful programming. Utilizing Deepgram's tools and resources can aid significantly in this process. For continued challenges, seeking assistance from Deepgram's support or community can provide additional guidance.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm working on a project that requires accurate transcription of spoken English, including filler words like 'uh' and 'um'. How can I enable this feature in Deepgram's API, and are there any potential issues I should be aware of?</CommunityQuestion>

When working with Deepgram's transcription services, users often seek to include filler words such as "um," "uh," or "mm" in their transcriptions. This functionality is particularly useful for creating more natural transcriptions that capture the nuances of spoken language.

## Enabling Filler Words

To enable the transcription of filler words in Deepgram's services, you need to set the `filler_words=true` parameter in your API request. This request can be applied to both pre-recorded and streaming audio, but it's important to note that this feature currently supports English language audio only and is available on the Nova, Nova-2, and Nova-3 models.

### API Example

Here is a tested code example using cURL to enable filler words in a transcription request:

```bash
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3&filler_words=true'
```

**Note**: Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key.

### Error Handling

To handle potential errors, consider the following enhancements to your implementation:

```bash
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3&filler_words=true' || {
    echo "Error: Failed to process audio. Please check your API key and audio file."
    exit 1
  }
```

## Troubleshooting Missing Filler Words

Despite enabling filler words, there can be situations where some filler words are not captured accurately:

1. **Audio Clarity**: Ensure your audio is clear and free from background noise or cross-talk. Clean and well-recorded audio increases transcription accuracy.
2. **Audio Length**: Testing with a variety of audio clips can provide better results. Short clips may not always give a representative sample.
3. **Model Confidence**: Occasionally, the model's confidence in detecting filler words may affect transcription. Trying different audio samples can help.
4. **Supported Language**: Make sure the audio is in English, as filler words are currently supported for English audio only.

## Conclusion

By appropriately setting up your API request and ensuring high-quality input audio, you can fully utilise Deepgram's ability to detect and transcribe filler words.

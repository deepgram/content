<CommunityQuestion>I am developing an application that requires Arabic text-to-speech capabilities. Does Deepgram support Arabic language for their text-to-speech API? If not, what alternatives can I explore?</CommunityQuestion>

Currently, Deepgram's Text-to-Speech (TTS) offerings are centered around the English language, and there is no support for Arabic TTS at this time. As a result, users requiring Arabic language capabilities for TTS need to utilize alternative services, such as Elevenlabs or other providers offering Arabic voice synthesis.

## Exploring Arabic TTS Options
While Deepgram focuses on English TTS, there are multiple avenues available for users needing Arabic TTS functionalities:

1. **Third-Party Services**: Some third-party TTS services specialize in supporting various languages, including Arabic.
2. **Open-Source Libraries**: Exploring open-source alternatives that offer localized TTS models might be beneficial.
3. **Custom Solutions**: Developing a custom TTS solution tailored to specific language requirements can be considered, although it may involve significant resources and expertise.

## Conclusion
While Deepgram does not currently support Arabic Text-to-Speech, alternatives exist for those who have specific language requirements. For users interested in employing Deepgram for English TTS, we provide robust SDKs in multiple languages to facilitate integration.

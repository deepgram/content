<CommunityQuestion>I'm building a text-to-speech application that requires handling large volumes of text input. What pricing options does Deepgram offer to accommodate high character usage while keeping costs manageable?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

When building a text-to-speech (TTS) application that processes large volumes of text, managing costs efficiently is crucial. Choosing the correct pricing plan from Deepgram can significantly impact your project's financial feasibility.

## Deepgram Pricing Plans

### Pay As You Go
This plan suits users with irregular or low-volume usage. It charges only for what you use without a minimum spending requirement, making it ideal for startups or projects in early development with unpredictable demand.

### Growth Plan
For higher usage, the Growth Plan offers discounted rates and access to all public models and APIs, including both Speech-to-Text (STT) and TTS. This plan is beneficial for businesses that require consistent service and are scaling operations.

### Enterprise Plan
If your annual spending exceeds $10,000, the Enterprise Plan provides competitive pricing with opportunities for further cost optimisations through tailored contracts.

## Cost Calculation Example
Using Deepgram's TTS services:
- **Basic Calculation**: At **$0.0135** per **1,000 characters**, processing **1 million characters** costs **$13.50**.

This example is vital for scenarios where extensive text is processed in batches, such as in customer interaction solutions with lengthy scripts.

## Tested Code Example

Here's a basic example of using the Deepgram API for text-to-speech:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak" \
     -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "text": "Your text input here",
           "model": "nova"
         }' \
     --output output.mp3
```

Ensure you replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Deepgram API key.

### Error Handling
Handle errors by checking the HTTP response status. A `429: Too Many Requests` error indicates rate limits, while other 4xx errors may indicate malformed requests.

## Recommendations

- For low to moderate TTS usage, start with the Pay As You Go plan.
- As demand grows, especially if integrating STT, consider the Growth Plan for cost efficiency.
- For high character throughput, explore text chunking strategies to maintain efficiency.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm building a text-to-speech application that requires handling large volumes of text input. What pricing options does Deepgram offer to accommodate high character usage while keeping costs manageable?</CommunityQuestion>

Deepgram offers a flexible pricing model depending on your usage needs. Understanding these options can help you choose the best plan for your text-to-speech (TTS) activities, especially if you're dealing with large volumes of text.

## Pricing Plans

### Pay As You Go
This plan is tailored for those who have irregular or low-volume usage of Deepgram's services. It allows you to pay only for the services you use, with no minimum spending requirement. This can be particularly suitable for startups or projects in development stages where usage is unpredictable.

### Growth Plan
For more extensive use, the Growth Plan provides discounted rates and access to all public models and APIs, including Speech-to-Text (STT) and TTS, making it ideal for businesses scaling their operations or requiring consistent service.

### Enterprise Plan
If your anticipated spending exceeds $10,000 annually, the Enterprise Plan offers competitive pricing and opportunities for further cost optimization through tailored contracts.

## Cost Calculation Example
If you're using Deepgram's TTS services:
- **Basic Calculation**: At the rate of **$0.0135** per **1,000 characters**, processing **1 million characters** would cost **$13.50**.

This comparison is crucial given scenarios where extensive text is processed in batches, such as in customer interaction solutions where scripts can be lengthy.

## Recommendations
- If you're initially dealing only with TTS and foresee low to moderate usage, the Pay As You Go plan may be most economical.
- As your demand grows, especially if incorporating STT, consider switching to the Growth Plan for better financial efficiency.

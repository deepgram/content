<CommunityQuestion>I'm having trouble getting Deepgram's live transcription to work properly. The WebSocket connection keeps failing, and I'm not sure why. What should I do to resolve these connection errors?</CommunityQuestion>

When implementing live transcription using Deepgram's WebSocket API, you might encounter connection errors. This guide provides steps to troubleshoot and resolve these errors efficiently.

## Initial Setup for Live Transcription

To initiate a live transcription using Deepgram's WebSocket API, ensure your client is configured correctly with the appropriate API endpoint and parameters.

If an error arises, follow the steps below to troubleshoot:

## Troubleshooting WebSocket Connection Errors

1. **Verify API Key Permissions**: Ensure your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions to access Deepgram's WebSocket API. Invalid credentials may result in errors such as `Invalid credentials`.

2. **Network Connectivity**: Check that your internet connection is stable. Use tools like `ping` and `traceroute` to diagnose network issues. Network instability can frequently cause WebSocket connection issues.

3. **Deepgram Service Status**: Check [Deepgram's status page](https://status.deepgram.com/) for any ongoing service outages or downtime that could be affecting your connection.

4. **SDK Version**: Ensure that you are using the most recent version of the Deepgram SDK. Updates often include bug fixes and improvements.

5. **Connection Retry**: If the server is temporarily unavailable, try reconnecting after a short delay. Implement exponential backoff to handle retries gracefully.

6. **Parameter Validity**: Review the parameters you are using in the WebSocket connection to ensure they are supported and correctly formatted. Incorrect parameters can lead to connection failures.

### Example Code with Error Handling

Below is a sample code snippet that demonstrates error handling for WebSocket connections using Python:

```python
import websockets
import asyncio
import json

async def start_transcription():
    uri = "wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"
    headers = {
        'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
    
    try:
        async with websockets.connect(uri, extra_headers=headers) as websocket:
            await websocket.send(json.dumps({"type": "start"}))
            async for message in websocket:
                print("Received:", message)
    except websockets.exceptions.InvalidStatusCode as e:
        print(f"Connection failed with status code: {e.status_code}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

asyncio.run(start_transcription())
```

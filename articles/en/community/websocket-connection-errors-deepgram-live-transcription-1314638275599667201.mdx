When attempting to implement live transcription using Deepgram's WebSocket API, you might encounter connection errors. This guide provides steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve these errors efficiently.

## Initial Setup for Live Transcription

To initiate a live transcription using Deepgram's WebSocket API, ensure you've configured your client correctly with the appropriate API endpoint and parameters.

If an error arises, follow the steps below to troubleshoot:

## Troubleshooting WebSocket Connection Errors

1. **Verify API Key Permissions**: Ensure your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions to access Deepgram's WebSocket API.

2. **Network Connectivity**: Check that your internet connection is stable. Network instability can frequently cause WebSocket connection issues.

3. **Deepgram Service Status**: Check [Deepgram's status page](https://status.deepgram.com/) for any ongoing service outages or downtime that could be affecting your connection.

4. **SDK Version**: Ensure that you are using the most recent version of the Deepgram SDK. Updates often include bug fixes and improvements.

5. **Connection Retry**: If the server is temporarily unavailable, try reconnecting after a short delay.

6. **Parameter Validity**: Review the parameters you are using in the WebSocket connection to make sure they are supported and correctly formatted.

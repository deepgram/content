# Resolving ENOTFOUND Error in Make.com Automations

## Understanding the "ENOTFOUND" Error

This error typically suggests that the service being referenced cannot be found or is inaccessible. Common causes include:

- **Network Connectivity Issues:** Check your internet connection. Interruptions could prevent the automation from communicating with the necessary endpoints.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm looking to enhance my company's customer service capabilities by analysing audio and video data from support interactions. Could Deepgram's multi-modal model capabilities help me achieve this effectively?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

You want to enhance customer service by analysing both audio and video data from support interactions. While Deepgram currently focuses on audio processing, this article explores the potential for integrating multi-modal models into the Deepgram API for more comprehensive analysis.

## Expanding API Capabilities

Incorporating multi-modal models into an API involves enhancing its capabilities to process and understand different types of data inputs, such as audio, video, and text, simultaneously. This approach allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the content, capturing nuances like tonality and sentiment that are not possible with audio-only processing.

### Potential Use Cases

1. **Customer Service Enhancement**: By capturing tonality and facial expressions from video alongside speech, companies can better assess customer satisfaction and agent performance.
2. **Education and Training**: Combining visual aids with speech transcription can enhance e-learning platforms, making content more engaging and interactive.
3. **Media and Entertainment**: Multi-modal models can be used to create richer content experiences by analysing viewer reactions and feedback in real-time.

## Technical Considerations

Implementing multi-modal models requires careful consideration of the following:

- **Data Synchronisation**: Ensuring that audio and visual data are accurately synchronised for coherent analysis.
- **Processing Power**: Multi-modal analysis is resource-intensive, requiring robust infrastructure for real-time processing.
- **Privacy and Security**: Handling additional data types necessitates stringent security measures to protect user privacy.

## Current Capabilities and Alternatives

Deepgram currently specialises in audio and speech-to-text capabilities. Here are some features you might leverage for enhanced audio analysis:

- **Diarization**: Identifying different speakers in an audio file.
- **Multichannel Processing**: Separating audio channels for independent analysis.
- **Keyterm Prompting**: Highlighting specific words or phrases within a transcription.

### Example: Using Diarization

To use diarization with Deepgram, you can send an API request like this:

```shell
curl \
  --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?diarize=true&punctuate=true' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'content-type: audio/mp3' \
  --data-binary @your-audio-file.mp3
```

Ensure you replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. This request will provide a transcription with speaker labels, which can be beneficial in understanding who said what during a conversation.

## Future Possibilities

While Deepgram currently focuses on audio and speech-to-text capabilities, the interest in multi-modal models reflects a natural progression in the field of AI-driven interactions. As the demand grows, such integrations may become more prevalent in the future.

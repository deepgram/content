<CommunityQuestion>I'm trying to transcribe Polish phone numbers with Deepgram's speech-to-text API, but I'm having trouble getting accurate results. How can I improve the recognition of numerical sequences in Polish using Deepgram?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

Transcribing Polish numerical sequences, such as phone numbers, using Deepgram's Speech-to-Text (STT) API can be challenging. Users often encounter difficulties in achieving accurate recognition, particularly with Polish numbers.

## Challenges with Transcribing Polish Numbers

While Deepgram's models handle English numerical sequences effectively, users have noted inconsistencies with other languages, including Polish. Previous attempts to improve accuracy using the `keywords` feature have shown limited success.

## Recommended Configuration with Nova-3

To optimise transcription accuracy for Polish numbers, it's advisable to use the latest Nova-3 model and the `keyterm prompting` feature, which offers better handling of specific terms.

### Sample Configuration

```python
from deepgram import Deepgram

# Initialize Deepgram with your API key
dg_client = Deepgram("YOUR_API_KEY")

# Configure transcription options
options = {
    "model": "nova-3",
    "language": "pl",
    "numerals": True,
    "keyterms": ["jeden", "dwa", "trzy", "cztery", "pięć", "sześć", "siedem", "osiem", "dziewięć"],
    "punctuate": True,
    "interim_results": True
}

# Example API call
response = dg_client.transcribe(
    audio_url='your_audio_file_url.wav',
    options=options
)

print(response)
```

Ensure you replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Deepgram API key.

## Steps Towards Improved Accuracy

- **Switch to Nova-3 Model**: Utilise the Nova-3 model for its enhanced capabilities in handling diverse languages.
- **Use Keyterm Prompting**: This feature is more effective than the deprecated `keywords` feature for specific word or phrase recognition.

## Conclusion

Deepgram continues to enhance its models to better support non-English languages, including Polish. By leveraging the latest features and models, users can expect improvements in transcription accuracy.

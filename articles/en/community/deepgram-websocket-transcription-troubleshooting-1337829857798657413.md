# Troubleshooting Deepgram WebSocket Transcription Setup


When setting up the Deepgram real-time transcription with a WebSocket, ensuring proper handling of audio chunks and WebSocket responses is crucial.

### Using Websockets
Establishing a WebSocket connection for transcribing audio in real-time with Deepgram involves sending audio data in appropriate chunks and handling server responses accurately. Missteps during this process can result in failed transcription retrieval.

### Common Challenges and Solutions

1. **Audio Chunk Size**
   
   If audio is sent in exceedingly small chunks, such as under 0.03 seconds each, this might not trigger a sufficient processing response from the Deepgram server. Ensure that audio data chunks are of a reasonable size, preferably around a few hundred milliseconds, to be processed efficiently.

2. **Handling WebSocket Responses**

   It’s important to handle WebSocket responses correctly. If you are waiting for a response from the server before sending additional audio chunks, make sure the implementation doesn’t inadvertently halt the transmission of further audio data until a response is received. This can lead to only part of the audio being sent to the server, preventing successful transcription.

3. **Configuration Validation**

   Double-check the WebSocket connection parameters, ensuring they match Deepgram's requirements. This includes verifying the correct WebSocket endpoint, authentication, and any query parameters necessary for your transcription configuration.

### Conclusion

Successfully configuring and troubleshooting a Deepgram WebSocket transcription setup involves ensuring proper audio chunking and response handling. Assure that the WebSocket flow is smooth and check for any blocking operations that await responses unnecessarily.

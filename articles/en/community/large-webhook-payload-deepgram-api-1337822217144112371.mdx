<CommunityQuestion>I'm having trouble receiving full transcripts from Deepgram's webhook when processing long audio files. Is there a way to reduce the payload size and avoid errors?</CommunityQuestion>

When utilizing Deepgram's Speech-to-Text API to transcribe lengthy audio files, users may encounter oversized webhook payloads. This occurs because the API, by default, provides multiple sections of transcript data, leading to significantly large payloads for extended audio files.

### Current Behavior
Currently, the API's webhook includes a detailed response that contains multiple sections of the same transcript data:
- **Full Transcripts** are included within `$.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript` and `$.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].paragraphs.transcript`.
- **Utterances** are reported in both `$.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].paragraphs.paragraphs` and `$.results.utterances`, leading to duplication.

For lengthy audio files, such detailed data can result in webhook payloads that exceed server capacity, triggering errors like the HTTP 413 "Request Entity Too Large."

### Possible Solutions
1. **Increase Server Capacity**: Adjust the server settings to handle larger payloads, if possible.

2. **Segment Audio Files**: Developers may opt to split audio into smaller segments before sending API requests to reduce the size of each webhook payload.

3. **Selective Data Feature**: While not yet implemented, there is discussion within Deepgram about a feature to send only necessary sections of data, such as utterances. This would substantially reduce payload size and is worth monitoring for future updates.

### Benefits of Selective Data
Reducing the webhook payload size benefits both Deepgram and its clients:
- **Bandwidth**: Potential reduction in data transmitted across networks.
- **Performance**: Faster processing times on the client side, minimizing the risk of payload-related errors.

### Conclusion
While Deepgram has not yet implemented selective data transmission in webhook responses, they recognize the need. For developers experiencing this issue, consider the above workaround strategies. If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Community](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

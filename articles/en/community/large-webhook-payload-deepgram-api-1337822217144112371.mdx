<CommunityQuestion>I'm having trouble receiving full transcripts from Deepgram's webhook when processing long audio files. Is there a way to reduce the payload size and avoid errors?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

When using Deepgram's Speech-to-Text API to transcribe lengthy audio files, users may encounter oversized webhook payloads. This situation often results in errors such as HTTP 413 "Request Entity Too Large," due to the large amount of transcript data sent back in the webhook response.

### Current Behavior

Deepgram's API webhook includes a detailed response with multiple sections of the same transcript data:
- **Full Transcripts**: Found in `$.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript`.
- **Utterances**: Reported in both `$.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].paragraphs.paragraphs` and `$.results.utterances`, leading to duplication.

For long audio files, these detailed data can result in webhook payloads exceeding server capacity.

### Possible Solutions

1. **Increase Server Capacity**: Adjust server settings to accommodate larger payloads. For instance, in Express.js, increase the bodyParser limit:
   ```javascript
   const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
   const app = require('express')();

   app.use(bodyParser.json({ limit: '5mb' }));
   ```
   Ensure the server is configured to handle larger payloads by adjusting similar settings on platforms like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) or [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs).

2. **Segment Audio Files**: Split audio into smaller segments before sending API requests. This approach reduces the size of each webhook payload.

3. **Monitor for New Features**: Deepgram may introduce features to send only necessary sections of data, such as utterances. Monitor updates for such enhancements to reduce payload size.

### Error Handling

If encountering the HTTP 413 error, consider the following steps:
- Confirm server configurations can handle the desired payload size.
- Implement error handling to manage large payloads gracefully:
  ```javascript
  app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
    try {
      // Process webhook data
      console.log(req.body);
      res.status(200).send('Processed Successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error processing webhook:', error);
      res.status(413).send('Payload Too Large');
    }
  });
  ```

### Benefits of Reducing Payload Size

Minimising webhook payload size offers several advantages:
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Reduces data transmitted, saving network resources.
- **Performance Improvement**: Faster client-side processing and reduced error risks.

### Conclusion

While Deepgram is yet to implement selective data transmission in webhook responses, developers can adopt the above strategies to manage large payloads.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm building a voice assistant application with Deepgram's API. How can I configure the assistant to initiate the conversation by speaking first, rather than waiting for the user to start speaking?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement
To enhance user interaction, configuring a voice agent to start a conversation by speaking first can be beneficial. This guide outlines how to configure Deepgram's Agent API to achieve this capability.

## Configuration Setup

To enable the voice agent to speak first, you need to create a configuration object that includes audio settings, model selection for listening and speaking, thought process instructions, and an initial context message.

### Sample Configuration

Below is an updated example of how to configure your voice agent:

```javascript
const config = {
  type: 'SettingsConfiguration',
  audio: {
    encoding: 'linear16',
    sample_rate: 16000,
  },
  agent: {
    listen: {
      model: 'nova-3',
    },
    speak: {
      model: 'aura-asteria-en',
    },
    think: {
      provider: 'openai',
      instructions: 'Provide helpful responses to user queries.',
      functions: [
        // Define your agent functions here
      ],
    },
  },
  context: {
    messages: [
      {
        content: 'Hello, how can I assist you today?',
        role: 'assistant',
      },
    ],
    replay: true,
  },
};
```

### Configuration Details

- **Audio Configuration**: Ensure the audio settings match your input source. The example uses `linear16` encoding and a sample rate of 16000 Hz.
- **Listen Model**: Utilise the latest `nova-3` model for improved accuracy and features.
- **Speak Model**: The `aura-asteria-en` model is used for text-to-speech output.
- **Thought Instructions**: Configure reasoning and response logic using a provider like OpenAI. Tailor instructions to improve interaction quality.
- **Initial Context Message**: Sets the agent to initiate the conversation with a welcoming message.

### Error Handling

Ensure proper error handling by capturing and logging errors during agent configuration and interaction. Here is an example:

```javascript
try {
  // Initialize and configure your agent
  initializeAgent(config);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error configuring the voice agent:', error.message);
  // Additional error handling procedures
}
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Agent Not Speaking**: Verify the configuration, especially the context messages and replay settings.
- **Unexpected Errors**: Check API key validity and ensure models are correctly specified.

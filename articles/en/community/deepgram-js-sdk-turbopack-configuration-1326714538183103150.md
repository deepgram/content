# Configuring Deepgram JS SDK with Turbopack

When integrating the Deepgram JavaScript SDK with Turbopack, you may encounter some compatibility issues. Given Turbopack is a newer tool and provides certain advantages in terms of build performance, configuring it correctly when working with specific SDKs like Deepgram's can be essential.

### Understanding Turbopack Compatibility

Turbopack is designed as an alternative to traditional bundlers and can provide faster builds for JavaScript applications. However, it may not always work seamlessly with all SDKs or libraries, including Deepgram's JavaScript SDK.

If you've integrated the Deepgram JS SDK (version `"deepgram/sdk": "^3.9.0"`) and experience issues with Turbopack, consider the following general tips to potentially solve the issue:

1. **Dependencies and Import Handling**: Turbopack might face issues with how dependencies are imported or require module resolution that differs from other bundlers. Ensure that all dependencies utilized by the SDK are correctly installed and their versions are compatible.

2. **Configurations**: Sometimes, custom configurations need to be added to Turbopack for certain libraries. Check Turbopack's documentation and configuration guides to see if any specific settings or plugins are required for successful integration.

3. **Error Logs and Community Support**: Look at any error messages or logs that are produced when using Turbopack. These could provide insights into what is going wrong. Additionally, leveraging community platforms, such as the [Deepgram GitHub repository](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk) for issues and discussions, can help find solutions or alternatives from other users who have encountered similar issues.

4. **Testing Builds**: Run local builds to verify changes incrementally or create minimal test environments that isolate the issue to see if adjustments to configurations can resolve the problem.

### Conclusion

As modern tools like Turbopack evolve, discrepancies in functionality with existing tools and SDKs can occur. It's crucial to stay updated with both the Turbopack's ongoing development and Deepgram's updates through their official channels and repositories.

If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Community on Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram)

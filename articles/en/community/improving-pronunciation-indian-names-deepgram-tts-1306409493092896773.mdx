<CommunityQuestion>I've been using text-to-speech APIs, but they often mispronounce Indian names like Prasanna or Mangesh. Is there a way to improve the pronunciation accuracy for names from different cultures when using Deepgram's TTS API?</CommunityQuestion>

When using text-to-speech (TTS) services, accurate pronunciation of names from different cultures can be challenging. This is particularly true for Indian names like Prasanna, Mangesh, and Anil, which may have pronunciation patterns that differ from standard English.

## Understanding the Challenge

Deepgram's TTS models are primarily optimized for English pronunciation. While they handle many common names well, names from other cultures may require special handling to achieve accurate pronunciation.

## Effective Strategies for Improved Pronunciation

Based on Deepgram's official documentation, here are practical approaches to improve the pronunciation of Indian names:

### 1. Phonetic Spelling Adjustments

You can adjust the spelling to guide the TTS engine toward the correct pronunciation:

| Original Name | Phonetic Spelling |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Prasanna      | Pra-san-na        |
| Mangesh       | Mun-gaysh         |
| Anil          | Ah-neel           |

### 2. Syllable Separation

Adding hyphens between syllables can help with proper emphasis and pronunciation:

```text
"My name is Man-gesh Pra-san-na."
```

### 3. Using Spelled-Out Pronunciations

For names that prove particularly challenging, you can provide a spelled-out pronunciation guide:

```text
"The developer's name is Anil (pronounced as Ah-neel)."
```

### 4. Natural Pauses

Add a short pause before difficult names to allow the TTS engine to process the name separately:

```text
"I'd like to introduce our team lead, . Prasanna, who will guide us today."
```

## Implementation Example

When calling the Deepgram TTS API, you can format the text to incorporate these strategies. Ensure to use the latest model such as "nova-3":

```json
{
  "text": "Today we have a presentation from Man-gaysh and Ah-neel about our new product.",
  "model": "nova-3"
}
```

## Error Handling

If adjustments do not yield the expected results, consider verifying the following:

- Ensure text formatting is correct (e.g., no extra spaces).
- Try alternative phonetic spellings if the initial attempt fails.
- Check if the latest model is used, as it has the most recent updates.

## Future Improvements

Deepgram continues to enhance its TTS models to better support diverse name pronunciations. As these improvements roll out, the need for manual adjustments will decrease.

# Understanding the UND_ERR_HEADERS_TIMEOUT Error with Deepgram Whisper Model

In this document, we explore the issue of encountering the `UND_ERR_HEADERS_TIMEOUT` error when utilizing the Deepgram Whisper model for transcribing extended audio files, specifically those up to one hour in length. Though initially successful with smaller files, longer file durations can trigger timeout errors, which may require adjustments to the processing duration.

## Understanding UND_ERR_HEADERS_TIMEOUT

The `UND_ERR_HEADERS_TIMEOUT` error occurs when the headers of a request are delayed beyond an acceptable timeframe, prompting a timeout response. This is often linked with long-running audio transcription requests, particularly relevant to Deepgram's Whisper model.

## Whisper Model Caveats

Deepgram's Whisper model has specific limitations compared to the regular Deepgram models. Here are key considerations:

- **Scalability:** Whisper models are inherently less scalable due to their architecture. For better performance, Deepgram's other models, such as Nova, should be considered, as they tend to return results faster and accommodate higher loads.
- **Timeout Duration:** A maximum transcription time of 10 minutes is enforced for all Deepgram models. Requests exceeding this duration will encounter a 504 error.

## Solution Approaches

### Increasing Processing Time

While the JavaScript SDK might not explicitly mention the ability to adjust timeout settings, alternative solutions can be explored:

1. **Chunking Audio Files:** Divide larger audio files into smaller segments under 10 minutes and transcribe each individually.
2. **Switching Models:** Transition to a more scalable model like Nova if performance on longer files is necessary.

### Seeking Assistance

For developers facing persistent issues, contacting support is advisable:

"If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Community on Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram)"

## Conclusion

The `UND_ERR_HEADERS_TIMEOUT` error is indicative of processing duration limitations, especially with Whisper models. Understanding model limitations and exploring alternate transcription strategies are essential for effective resolution.

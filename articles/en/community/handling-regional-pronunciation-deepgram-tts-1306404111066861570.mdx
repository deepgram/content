<CommunityQuestion>I'm having trouble with Deepgram's Text-to-Speech service pronouncing some regional names correctly, especially those from the Indian subcontinent. Does anyone have any tips for improving the pronunciation of these types of names?</CommunityQuestion>

When using Deepgram's Text-to-Speech (TTS) service, you may encounter challenges in accurately pronouncing regional names, such as those from the Indian subcontinent. While some names may be pronounced correctly, others might not be due to phonetic limitations. At present, the TTS service does not support custom pronunciation adjustments.

## Enhancing Pronunciation

Though official support for international phonetic alphabets (IPA) is unavailable, there are a few strategies users can apply to improve regional pronunciation:

- **Modify Spellings**: Experiment with alternate spellings of words, focusing on how they sound phonetically in context. This might involve breaking down names into parts that better represent their sound in conventional English spelling. For example, a name with a unique pronunciation may need to be respelled to reflect how it is phonetically pronounced.

- **Sound Out Names**: Try to render names in a way that sounds out the phonetics. This approach tries to break down the name into syllables or sounds that can be more easily handled by the TTS.

While these solutions might require some trial-and-error, they can provide temporary fixes to pronunciation issues. However, these are not guaranteed, and their effectiveness can vary based on the complexity of pronunciation and the regional dialect.

## Current Limitations

Currently, Deepgram does not provide a solution for custom IPA inputs or alternate phonetic spellings. The focus remains largely on conventional English phonetics, which may not cover regional and cultural variations without some manipulation from the user.

## Conclusion

While Deepgram's TTS has certain limitations in pronouncing regional names accurately, experimenting with spelling adjustments can offer some improvement. Users seeking precise control over pronunciation may need to consider additional tools or services that support phonetic inputs.

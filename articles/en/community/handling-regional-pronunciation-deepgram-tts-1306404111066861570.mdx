<CommunityQuestion>I'm having trouble with Deepgram's Text-to-Speech service pronouncing some regional names correctly, especially those from the Indian subcontinent. Does anyone have any tips for improving the pronunciation of these types of names?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

When using Deepgram's Text-to-Speech (TTS) service, you may encounter challenges in accurately pronouncing regional names, such as those from the Indian subcontinent. This can be due to phonetic limitations and the lack of support for custom pronunciation adjustments.

## Enhancing Pronunciation

While official support for international phonetic alphabets (IPA) is unavailable, there are strategies to improve regional pronunciation:

- **Modify Spellings**: Experiment with alternate spellings of words to better represent their sound phonetically in English. This might involve breaking down names into parts that reflect their actual pronunciation.

- **Sound Out Names**: Render names by breaking them into syllables or sounds, making it easier for the TTS to process.

These methods can offer temporary fixes to pronunciation issues through trial and error, though effectiveness may vary.

## Error Handling

When modifying spellings or phonetics, unexpected results may occur. Consider these tips for handling errors:

- **Test Variations**: Try multiple phonetic variations to see which one yields the best results.
- **Monitor Output**: Check the TTS output for any mispronunciations and adjust your input accordingly.

## Alternative Solutions

For users needing precise control over pronunciation, consider these additional tools that support phonetic inputs:

- **Phonetic Transcription Tools**: Use external tools to create phonetic representations of the text before inputting into Deepgram TTS.
- **Third-Party APIs**: Explore other TTS services that might offer more robust phonetic support.

## Current Limitations

Currently, Deepgram does not support custom IPA inputs or alternate phonetic spellings. The focus is on conventional English phonetics, requiring user manipulation for regional variations.

## Conclusion

Deepgram's TTS can struggle with regional pronunciations, but experimenting with spelling adjustments can offer improvements. For more precise pronunciation, alternative tools or services may be necessary.

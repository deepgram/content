<CommunityQuestion>I've added some functions to my Deepgram Voice Agent settings, but the agent doesn't seem to be responding properly. The transcription works fine, but the interactive responses are missing. How can I troubleshoot this issue?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

When integrating Deepgram's Voice Agent API into your application, you may encounter situations where the agent does not respond if functions are added to your settings message. Although transcription messages are received appropriately, the expected interactive response from the agent might be absent. This guide outlines how to address and troubleshoot these issues effectively.

## Understanding Returned Messages

The Voice Agent API interactions typically start with a series of system messages. Here's a breakdown:

- **Welcome Message**: Indicates a successful connection and session initiation.
- **Settings Applied**: Confirms that your settings have been applied.
- **ConversationText**: Shows the text of spoken messages for both the user and the assistant.
- **AgentAudioDone**: Marks the end of an agent's spoken response.
- **UserStartedSpeaking**: Detects that the user has begun speaking again.
- **EndOfThought**: Signifies the completion of a user's input.

In a typical flow without custom function implementation, the agent responds appropriately. However, when functions are incorporated, and no response is observed, it's crucial to troubleshoot the function definitions.

## Key Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Ensure Correct Function Definitions**:
   - Ensure that when defining functions, each field is accounted for, even if the value is an empty list or dictionary. Skip none.
   - Missing fields or values can disrupt the function handling and lead to silent errors.

   ```json
   {
     "type": "SettingsConfiguration",
     "agent": {
       "think": {
         "functions": [
           {
             "name": "fetchWeather",
             "description": "Fetches weather data",
             "url": "https://api.weather.com/v3/wx/conditions/current",
             "headers": [
               {
                 "key": "authorization",
                 "value": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
               }
             ],
             "method": "get",
             "parameters": {
               "type": "object",
               "properties": {
                 "location": {
                   "type": "string",
                   "description": "Location for weather data"
                 }
               },
               "required": ["location"]
             }
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Review API Responses**:
   - Capture and log all incoming messages during your API session to identify patterns in missed agent responses.
   - Compare successful and failed sessions to discern issues.

3. **Verify Compatibility with Models**:
   - Confirm that the functions applied align with the model’s capability you’re using. While models like `nova-3` handle certain operations, discrepancies could arise if assumptions are mismatched.

4. **Utilise Debug Logging**:
   - Activate comprehensive logging to trace the flow of data and detect where communication breakdowns may occur.

   ```javascript
   function logIncomingMessages(message) {
     console.log("Received message:", message);
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

When integrating Deepgram's Voice Agent API, especially using custom function definitions, meticulous attention to structural details ensures proper agent responses. If issues persist or the system behaviour seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

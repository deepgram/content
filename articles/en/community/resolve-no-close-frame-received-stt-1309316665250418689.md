# Resolving 'No Close Frame Received' in Deepgram STT API

When working with Deepgram's Speech-to-Text (STT) API, one might encounter the error "no close frame received or sent." This issue often arises when using WebSockets, particularly with streaming or live transcription services. Ensuring a stable connection and appropriately managing application logic can help resolve this issue.

### Understanding the Error

The "no close frame received or sent" message typically indicates that a WebSocket connection was terminated without the expected close handshake. WebSockets are designed to maintain persistent connections, which require proper opening and closing sequences. A missing close frame suggests an abrupt disconnection, either from the client-side or external factors like network instability.

### Common Causes and Solutions

1. **Improper Connection Handling:**
   - Ensure your WebSocket implementation correctly handles the opening and closing of connections.
   - Upon completion of data transmission, always call the `close()` method on your WebSocket object to gracefully terminate the connection.

2. **Network Instability:**
   - Check your internet connection's stability. Unstable networks can interrupt WebSocket communications.
   - Consider implementing reconnection logic in case the connection is dropped unexpectedly.

3. **Proxy or Firewall Restrictions:**
   - Ensure any proxy servers or firewalls in use do not block or limit WebSocket connections.
   - Review the configurations to allow steady WebSocket traffic.

4. **SDK and Libraries:**
   - If using an SDK, make sure itâ€™s up to date. Older SDKs might not handle certain connection scenarios optimally.
   - Review [Deepgram SDKs Documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/deepgram-sdks) for more details 

### Alternative Solution: REST API

For those encountering persistent issues with WebSockets, transitioning to Deepgram's REST API for pre-recorded audio might be a viable solution. While it may not suit live needs, for many applications, the REST API provides a stable alternative without the complications of managing a WebSocket connection.

### Conclusion

Following the practices above can mitigate the "no close frame received or sent" error. Proper connection handling, checking network status, configuring security tools, and ensuring SDK updates are key to maintaining uninterrupted service.

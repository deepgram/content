<CommunityQuestion>I have a pre-recorded audio file that I need to transcribe in near real-time. How can I use Deepgram's API to stream the transcription of the file as it's being processed?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement
Transcribing pre-recorded audio files in near real-time can be challenging, especially when updates are required as the audio is processed. Using Deepgram's API, you can stream the transcription of an audio file, leveraging WebSockets for efficient and timely updates.

### Understanding Streaming vs. Pre-recorded Transcription
Deepgram offers two modes for transcription:
- **Streaming Transcription**: Processes audio data as it is being received, providing immediate transcriptions using WebSockets.
- **Pre-recorded Transcription**: Processes complete audio files after they are fully uploaded, offering slightly lower word error rates due to more context.

### Recommended Approach for Streaming Pre-recorded Audio Files
To transcribe an audio file in a streaming fashion, you can use Deepgram's streaming capabilities via WebSockets. The live-streaming starter kit found in the Deepgram GitHub repository is an excellent starting point for this purpose.

#### Steps to Implement:
1. **Access the Live-Streaming Starter Kit**: Utilize the [live-streaming starter kit](https://github.com/deepgram/live-streaming-starter-kit) available on GitHub.

2. **Configure WebSockets**: Establish a WebSocket connection to Deepgram using the correct endpoint and parameters:
   ```plaintext
   wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?encoding=linear16&sample_rate=16000&model=nova-3&smart_format=true
   ```

3. **Chunk and Send Data**: Stream the audio file by sending chunks of appropriate size:
   - Recommended chunk size: 20-40ms of audio
   - Ensure consistent chunk size for optimal performance
   - Use a buffer to manage audio chunks and maintain steady streaming

### Optimising Streaming Performance
1. **Audio Format**:
   - Use 16-bit PCM encoding
   - Sample rate of 16kHz
   - Mono or stereo channels as needed

2. **Connection Management**:
   - Implement connection retry logic
   - Handle disconnections gracefully
   - Use appropriate timeouts

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Monitor for transcription errors
   - Implement appropriate retry mechanisms
   - Log and track performance metrics

### Example Implementation

```python
import asyncio
import websockets
import json

async def stream_audio_file(file_path):
    try:
        async with websockets.connect(
            "wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?encoding=linear16&sample_rate=16000&model=nova-3&smart_format=true",
            extra_headers={"Authorization": f"Token YOUR_API_KEY"}
        ) as websocket:
            with open(file_path, "rb") as audio_file:
                while True:
                    chunk = audio_file.read(3200)  # 20ms of 16kHz 16-bit audio
                    if not chunk:
                        break
                    await websocket.send(chunk)
                    response = await websocket.recv()
                    print(json.loads(response)["results"]["channels"][0]["alternatives"][0]["transcript"])
    except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError as e:
        print(f"Connection closed with error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage
# asyncio.run(stream_audio_file("path/to/your/audiofile.wav"))
```

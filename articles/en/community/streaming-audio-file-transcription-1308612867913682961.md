# Streaming Audio File Transcription with Deepgram

When working with Deepgram's transcription services, users often seek to transcribe pre-recorded audio in a streaming fashion to receive updates as the audio is processed. This guide outlines how to achieve streaming transcription of an audio file using Deepgram's available resources.

### Understanding Streaming vs. Pre-recorded Transcription
Deepgram offers two modes for transcription:
- **Streaming Transcription**: This mode processes audio data as it is being received, providing immediate transcriptions. It uses WebSockets for real-time processing.
- **Pre-recorded Transcription**: This mode processes complete audio files after they are fully uploaded, offering slightly lower word error rates due to more context being available from the full file.

### Recommended Approach for Streaming Pre-recorded Audio Files
To transcribe an audio file in a streaming fashion, you can use Deepgram's streaming capabilities via WebSockets. The live-streaming starter kit found in the Deepgram GitHub repository is an excellent starting point for this purpose.

#### Steps to Implement:
1. **Access the Live-Streaming Starter Kit**: Utilize the [live-streaming starter kit](https://github.com/deepgram/live-streaming-starter-kit) available on GitHub.

2. **Configure WebSockets**: Establish a WebSocket connection to Deepgram using the correct endpoint and parameters:
   ```
   wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?encoding=linear16&sample_rate=16000&model=nova&smart_format=true
   ```

3. **Chunk and Send Data**: Stream the audio file by sending chunks of appropriate size:
   - Recommended chunk size: 20-40ms of audio
   - Ensure consistent chunk size for optimal performance
   - Use a buffer to manage audio chunks and maintain steady streaming

### Optimizing Streaming Performance

1. **Audio Format**:
   - Use 16-bit PCM encoding
   - Sample rate of 16kHz
   - Mono or stereo channels as needed

2. **Connection Management**:
   - Implement connection retry logic
   - Handle disconnections gracefully
   - Use appropriate timeouts

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Monitor for transcription errors
   - Implement appropriate retry mechanisms
   - Log and track performance metrics

### Example Implementation

```python
import asyncio
import websockets
import json

async def stream_audio_file(file_path):
    async with websockets.connect(
        "wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?encoding=linear16&sample_rate=16000&model=nova&smart_format=true",
        extra_headers={"Authorization": f"Token {YOUR_API_KEY}"}
    ) as websocket:
        with open(file_path, "rb") as audio_file:
            while True:
                chunk = audio_file.read(3200)  # 20ms of 16kHz 16-bit audio
                if not chunk:
                    break
                await websocket.send(chunk)
                response = await websocket.recv()
                print(json.loads(response)["results"]["channels"][0]["alternatives"][0]["transcript"])
```

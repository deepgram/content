<CommunityQuestion>I've integrated Deepgram's transcription callback with a GCP bucket, but I'm encountering a 403 error. What could be causing this issue, and how can I debug it?</CommunityQuestion>

When integrating Deepgram's transcription callback with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) buckets and encountering a 403 error, there can be a few steps to ensure that the Signed URL is correctly configured and supported. This guide provides troubleshooting tips for solving issues with GCP bucket integration.

### Understanding Signed URL 403 Errors

Signed URLs provide limited permission and allow anyone with the URL to perform certain actions within an allotted time, even without authentication. A 403 error typically means that the server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it.

### Steps to Debug 403 Error on GCP Signed URLs

1. **Check Signed URL Configuration**: Ensure the Signed URL is properly generated with the required permissions for the `PUT` method. Assign the permission to allow `application/json` when creating the signed URL.
   
2. **Verify Headers**:
   Make sure the HTTP headers, especially `Content-Type`, are correctly set within your HTTP request when using the signed URL.

3. **GCP Bucket Settings**: Verify the permissions and settings of your GCP bucket. The bucket should allow public access for the specified actions or should be configured with the appropriate policies for access via Signed URLs.

4. **Validity of the Signed URL**: Ensure that the signed URL is not expired. Signed URLs have a limited window during which they are valid, and using it outside of this window will result in a 403 error.

5. **Regional Restrictions**: Make sure there are no regional access restrictions if your GCP bucket and the request originate from different regions.

### Deepgram Integration

Deepgram supports various cloud storage services for retrieval of audio files using their URLs, and GCP buckets can be used effectively as long as URL permissions are managed correctly.

Refer to our pre-signed URL documentation: https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/using-aws-s3-presigned-urls-with-the-deepgram-api#accessing-deepgram-from-aws-lambda

### Conclusion

If all configurations seem correct and issues persist, further debugging may be needed by enabling verbose logging or utilizing tools such as curl with verbose output to gain more insight into the interactions between your application and the GCP bucket.

<CommunityQuestion>How can I securely manage API keys when using Deepgram's speech-to-text API in a web application? I'm concerned about potential key exposure and misuse.</CommunityQuestion>

Managing API keys efficiently is crucial for establishing secure and effective connections to Deepgram's speech-to-text API. Implementing short-lived API keys is a robust method to enhance security, particularly for in-browser applications. This article will guide you through key considerations when using short-lived API keys.

## Understanding API Key Management

When designing your system to handle short-lived API keys, it's essential to consider the lifecycle of these keys â€” from creation, active use, to deletion. Here's a basic run-through of the actions:

1. **Creating API Keys**: Generate API keys for user sessions and associate them with user profiles to track usage.
2. **Using API Keys**: Establish a secure connection using the API key. Ensure API keys are never exposed in client-side code.
3. **Deleting API Keys**: After successfully establishing a connection, delete the API key to prevent unauthorized reuse.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Tracking Usage**: By associating API keys with users, you can monitor and detect any suspicious activity.
- **Setting Expiration**: Assign a short expiration to API keys (e.g., 10 seconds) to limit potential misuse.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to safeguard against abuse of API calls.

## Conclusion

By implementing short-lived keys with these considerations, you can maintain a secure connection environment for your Deepgram integrations. Remember, owing to no automatic expiration policy in Deepgram, manual cleanup is crucial.

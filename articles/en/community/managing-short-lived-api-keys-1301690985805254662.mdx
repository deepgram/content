<CommunityQuestion>How can I securely manage API keys when using Deepgram's speech-to-text API in a web application? I'm concerned about potential key exposure and misuse.</CommunityQuestion>

Managing API keys efficiently is crucial for establishing secure and effective connections to Deepgram's speech-to-text API. Implementing short-lived API keys is a robust method to enhance security, particularly for in-browser applications. This article will guide you through key considerations when using short-lived API keys.

## Understanding API Key Management

When designing your system to handle short-lived API keys, it's essential to consider the lifecycle of these keys â€” from creation, active use, to deletion. Here's a basic run-through of the actions:

1. **Creating API Keys**: Generate API keys for user sessions and associate them with user profiles to track usage.
2. **Using API Keys**: Establish a secure connection using the API key. Ensure API keys are never exposed in client-side code.
3. **Deleting API Keys**: After successfully establishing a connection, delete the API key to prevent unauthorized reuse.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Tracking Usage**: By associating API keys with users, you can monitor and detect any suspicious activity.
- **Setting Expiration**: Assign a short expiration to API keys (e.g., 10 seconds) to limit potential misuse.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to safeguard against abuse of API calls.

## Code Examples

To create a short-lived API key, you can utilise Deepgram's ephemeral auth API. Here is a cURL example:

```shell
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.deepgram.com/v1/auth/keys \
     --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
       "comment": "Temporary Key",
       "scopes": ["usage:read"],
       "expires_in": 10
     }'
```

This example demonstrates creating a temporary API key that expires after 10 seconds. Make sure to handle any errors in your implementation:

```python
import requests

def create_temp_key(api_key):
    url = "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/auth/keys"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Token {api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data = {
        "comment": "Temporary Key",
        "scopes": ["usage:read"],
        "expires_in": 10
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
        return None

temp_key = create_temp_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Error Handling

Common errors you might encounter include:
- **Invalid API Key**: Ensure your API key is correct and active.
- **Expired Key**: Verify the expiration time and recreate the key as necessary.
- **Permission Denied**: Check the assigned scopes and ensure they match your intended use.

Handling errors appropriately will ensure a more robust application.

## Conclusion

By implementing short-lived keys with these considerations, you can maintain a secure connection environment for your Deepgram integrations. Remember, owing to no automatic expiration policy in Deepgram, manual cleanup is crucial.

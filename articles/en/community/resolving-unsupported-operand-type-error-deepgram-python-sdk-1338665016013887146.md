# Resolving Unsupported Operand Type Error in Deepgram Python SDK

When using the Deepgram Python SDK for speech-to-text transcription, you may encounter an exception related to unsupported operand types. This issue generally stems from using an outdated version of the SDK, causing incompatibilities in the operation of the `LiveClient._listening` method.

## Error Description

The error may appear with a message similar to the following:

```
Deepgram exception: {'type': 'Exception', 'description': 'Exception in LiveClient._listening', 'message': "unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'float' and 'NoneType'", 'variant': ''}
```

This indicates that there is a type mismatch during a subtraction operation, where a `float` and a `NoneType` are being used together, likely due to a latency or timing calculation issue.

## Resolution Steps

1. **Update the SDK**: Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Deepgram Python SDK. This can potentially fix the issue if it is related to improvements or bug fixes in the latest release.
   - You can update the SDK with the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade deepgram-sdk
     ```

2. **Validate Input and Configuration**: Double-check your input audio files for any anomalies and ensure your application configuration aligns with the requirements in the [Deepgram API documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/getting-started-with-pre-recorded-audio).

3. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement error handling and logging to capture and diagnose exceptions more effectively. This may give more insight into whether the issue is related to the input data or network conditions.

4. **Seek Support**: If updating does not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to Deepgram support. They may offer more detailed diagnostic advice or confirm if the issue has been identified and resolved in any subsequent releases.

<CommunityQuestion>I've recently upgraded to Next.js 15 and started using Turbopack, but now I'm encountering an error with the Deepgram SDK. Is there a known issue, and are there any workarounds to get the SDK working properly?</CommunityQuestion>

When working with the Deepgram JavaScript SDK in a Next.js 15 environment, some users have reported encountering the error "ReferenceError: Cannot access 'isBrowser' before initialization." This issue seems to stem from compatibility problems between the Deepgram SDK and the new features introduced in Next.js 15, including Turbopack.

## Understanding the Error

The error indicates a scope problem where a variable, likely `isBrowser`, is being accessed before it has been properly initialized. This suggests that the Deepgram SDK may not yet fully support the latest changes in Next.js 15, particularly the integration with Turbopack.

## Current Workarounds

1. **Use Next.js 14**: If you do not specifically need the features provided by Next.js 15, consider downgrading to Next.js 14 where the Deepgram SDK functions correctly. This version is stable with the SDK and doesn't introduce the same scope errors.

2. **Monitor GitHub Issues**: Keep an eye on the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk/issues/346) that tracks this problem. Engaging with the community there can provide updates or alternate solutions that may arise.

3. **Await SDK Updates**: The Deepgram team might develop a specific library or update that addresses compatibility with Next.js 15, which could resolve these issues without having to revert to older versions.

## Conclusion

This error highlights the importance of ensuring compatibility when using third-party SDKs with new JavaScript frameworks and builds systems. As Next.js continues to evolve, maintaining compatibility will be a priority for SDK developers like Deepgram.

For those needing immediate compatibility with Next.js 15 features, reaching out to the Deepgram support team or discussing in the [Deepgram community](https://discord.gg/deepgram) can provide additional support and updates.

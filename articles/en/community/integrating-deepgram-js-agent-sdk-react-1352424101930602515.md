# Integrating Deepgram JS Agent SDK with React for Voice Commands

Integrating voice commands in a React application using the Deepgram JS Agent SDK is not only feasible but can significantly enhance the user experience by allowing users to navigate through voice commands. Here's a guide on how to implement this in your React app.

To begin, you need to ensure that your application is set up to handle command inputs and translate them into actions, such as navigating different pages. The Deepgram JS Agent SDK is equipped for client and server-side JavaScript, making it adaptable for React applications.

## Setup and Integration

### Installation
First, you need to add the Deepgram JS Agent SDK to your project. You can install this package via npm:

```bash
npm install @deepgram/agent-sdk
```

### Implementing Voice Command Functionality

In your React application, create a component that listens for voice input and triggers a callback when a command is recognized. This component will use the SDK to interact with the agent capabilities.

1. **Configure the SDK**: Initialize and configure the SDK in your component, ensuring you replace placeholders with actual configuration values such as your API key.

2. **Creating Voice Commands**: Set up the necessary functions to invoke actions such as routing changes within your React app. You can achieve this by using functions like `useNavigate` from React Router to change the applicationâ€™s path when a command is spoken.

3. **Handling Commands**: Implement logic to handle recognized commands, translating them to actions. For example, if the user says "navigate to my dashboard", you can programmatically redirect them there using React Router's `navigate` function.

```javascript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { DeepgramAgent } from '@deepgram/agent-sdk';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const VoiceCommandComponent = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  useEffect(() => {
    const agent = new DeepgramAgent({
      apiKey: 'your-api-key-here'
    });

    agent.onCommand((command) => {
      switch(command) {
        case 'navigate to my dashboard':
          navigate('/dashboard');
          break;
        // handle other commands
      }
    });
  }, [navigate]);

  return <div>Voice Command Active</div>;
};
```

By structuring your application this way, you leverage the power of Deepgram's voice recognition to enhance user interaction with your React application.

## Conclusion
Integrating voice commands in your React application using the Deepgram JS Agent SDK provides a seamless way to enhance interactivity. Implementing this capability involves setting up the SDK and handling voice commands to trigger application routing and actions.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm generating synthetic voices with AI for an audiobook project, but the transcription service I'm using can't distinguish between the different voices. Is there any way to improve speaker diarization for AI-generated audio on Deepgram?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

When working with AI-generated voices on Deepgram's transcription API, obtaining accurate speaker diarization can sometimes pose challenges. In these cases, all utterances may be attributed to a single speaker, even when different AI voices are used. This can hinder the effectiveness of transcription services in distinguishing between speakers.

## Factors Affecting Speaker Diarization

1. **Audio Quality:** The effectiveness of diarization can be significantly impacted by the quality of the audio. Ensuring clear, high-quality audio with minimal background noise and cross-talk will help improve results.

2. **Model Selection:** Deepgram offers various models, such as 'nova-3', that handle speaker separation differently. If one model does not meet expectations, testing with another supported model is recommended.

3. **Multi-Channel Audio:** Although not always feasible, using dual-channel audio can dramatically improve diarization accuracy. Each speaker is recorded on a separate channel, providing the model with clearer distinctions.

## Implementation Using Deepgram API

To enable diarization with Deepgram's API, use the following code example to process an AI-generated audio file:

```bash
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?diarize=true&model=nova-3'
```

Ensure you replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Deepgram API key. This example uses the latest Nova 3 model for optimal results.

## Error Handling

When experimenting with different models and configurations, you might encounter errors. Common issues include:

- **Authentication Error**: Ensure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.
- **Invalid Audio Format**: Verify that your audio file meets Deepgram's requirements for supported formats.

Consider adding error handling in your implementation to manage these scenarios gracefully.

## Future Improvements

Deepgram is developing new diarization models aimed at improving the experience and accuracy for complex audio scenarios, including AI-generated voices. While the release timeline for this model is not yet available, users who can await these updates may find significant improvements.

## Interim Solutions

In the meantime, experimenting with different model and parameter combinations may yield better outcomes. Collaborating with Deepgram support specialists or exploring the community forums can also uncover insights and lesser-known configurations that have worked for other users.

## Support Channels

For enhanced guidance, users can reach out to Deepgram experts through the available community platforms or directly engage with support representatives for tailored assistance:

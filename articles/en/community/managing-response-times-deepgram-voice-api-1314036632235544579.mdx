<CommunityQuestion>I'm building a chatbot with Deepgram's Speech-to-Text API, but I'm finding the transcription response times to be quite slow at times, causing my chatbot to feel unresponsive. What can I do to improve the transcription speed and maintain a smooth conversational experience?</CommunityQuestion>

When developing a conversational AI platform using Deepgram's Speech-to-Text API, ensuring consistent response times is crucial to maintain the fluidity and effectiveness of interactions. Delays over a few seconds can interrupt the flow of conversation, leading to a suboptimal user experience.

## Understanding Transcription Speed

Deepgram offers several model options for transcription, including their latest *Nova 3* model, which is optimised for speed and accuracy. Using the latest model can significantly improve transcription times compared to older or non-Deepgram models.

### Predicting and Preventing Delays

While specific guarantees on response times (Service-Level Agreements) are not available, there are strategies you can employ to mitigate delay issues:

- **Model Selection:** Use Deepgram's *Nova 3* model for faster and more reliable transcription.
  
  ```shell
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "model": "nova3"
    }' \
    "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"
  ```

- **Optimise Audio Files:** Consider splitting larger audio files into smaller segments to reduce processing delays.

- **Parameter Tuning:** Carefully adjust parameters in your API requests. For instance, using the `tier` parameter can help balance between speed and cost. 

  ```shell
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "tier": "enhanced"
    }' \
    "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"
  ```

### Error Handling and Timeout Considerations

Be aware of the system's default timeout settings. For example, Deepgram imposes a 10-minute timeout on all transcription requests. If exceeded, requests are terminated with a 504 error.

```python
import requests

try:
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen",
        headers={"Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"},
        json={"url": "your-audio-url"},
        timeout=600
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
    print("The request timed out. Try reducing the audio length or checking your network connection.")
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as err:
    if err.response.status_code == 504:
        print("Error 504: Gateway Timeout. The request took too long to process.")
    else:
        print(f"HTTP error occurred: {err}")

```

## Troubleshooting and Support

In case of persistent delays or unexpected system behaviour, gather as much contextual information about the problem as possible, such as:

- `request_id` for your API transactions.
- The full API request URL with parameters.
- Code snippets detailing your implementation.

With this data, reach out to your Deepgram support representative or visit the community support platforms for assistance: [Discord community](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

## Conclusion

By selecting the appropriate model and optimising your requests, you can achieve faster response times conducive to live conversation workflows. Additionally, staying in tune with Deepgram's community channels provides a resource for troubleshooting and improving your integration.

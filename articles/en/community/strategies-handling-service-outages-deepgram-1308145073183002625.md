# Strategies for Handling Service Outages with Deepgram

In any production environment, dealing with service interruptions or outages can be a challenge. Oftentimes, while using services like Deepgram's speech recognition platform, unexpected interruptions can occur. Here we explore strategies that can mitigate the impact of such outages. 

## Understanding Service Redundancy
Deepgram maintains a robust infrastructure with multiple levels of redundancy and high availability designed to minimize interruptions and service outages. However, like any complex software system, it is impossible to completely eliminate the risk of issues arising.

## Implementing Decoupled Systems
One effective way to handle outages is by implementing decoupled system architectures. Integrating message queues can buffer and relay data once a connection is reestablished, ensuring that temporary disruptions do not lead to data loss or service failures. This is especially helpful when integrating Deepgram's real-time services, like the [speech-to-text streaming](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/getting-started-with-live-streaming-audio) capabilities.

## Backups and Alternative Providers
Having a backup or alternative provider can reduce the impact of outages. While Deepgram excels in terms of accuracy and performance when operational, implementing a failover strategy to switch to a different provider during outages can ensure continuous service availability. This approach is recommended during trial phases or high-dependability scenarios.

## Monitoring and Responsive Systems
Leverage status monitoring tools such as [Deepgram's Status Dashboard](https://status.deepgram.com/) to stay informed about service availability and potential issues. Responsive systems that can alert and adapt to these real-time updates can significantly reduce the business impact of any outages.

## Conclusion
While Deepgram is continuously improving its service reliability and deploys robust redundancy measures, integrating best practices in service decoupling, backup plans, and real-time monitoring can further stabilize the experience for users during unexpected outages.

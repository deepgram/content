<CommunityQuestion>I'm having trouble verifying my account on the Deepgram Discord server. The browser window gets stuck after clicking 'get verified'. Could you please help me resolve this issue?</CommunityQuestion>

Navigating the verification process for the Deepgram Discord channel is crucial for accessing the full suite of community interactions and resources. If you're experiencing issues during the verification process in Discord—such as the browser window getting stuck after clicking 'get verified'—there are some steps you can take to resolve this issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Browser Check**
   - Make sure to try the verification process in multiple browsers if you encounter problems in your default one. Sometimes, certain browsers might block pop-ups or scripts needed for verification.

2. **Disable Pop-up Blockers**
   - Check if you have a pop-up blocker enabled in your browser that could be preventing the verification page from loading properly. Try temporarily disabling the pop-up blocker and see if the issue persists.

3. **Clear Cache and Cookies**
   - Occasionally, clearing the cache and cookies in your browser settings can help resolve issues where pages fail to load correctly.

4. **Update Browser**
   - Ensure your browser is up-to-date as older versions might not support all website functionalities needed for verification.

5. **Try Incognito Mode**
   - Incognito or private browsing modes do not use existing cookies and cache, which could help rule out issues related to stored data.

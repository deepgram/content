<CommunityQuestion>I'm having trouble verifying my account on the Deepgram Discord server. The browser window gets stuck after clicking 'get verified'. Could you please help me resolve this issue?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement
Verification issues when joining the Deepgram Discord server can prevent users from accessing the full suite of community interactions and resources. The problem often manifests as the browser window getting stuck after clicking 'get verified'.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Browser Check**
   - Attempt the verification process in different browsers if you encounter issues with your default one. Some browsers may block pop-ups or scripts necessary for verification.

2. **Disable Pop-up Blockers**
   - Ensure that pop-up blockers are disabled, as they may prevent the verification page from loading correctly. Temporarily disable them to see if the issue resolves.

3. **Clear Cache and Cookies**
   - Clearing your browser's cache and cookies can help resolve issues where pages do not load properly.

4. **Update Browser**
   - Make sure your browser is up-to-date. Older versions might lack support for all the website functionalities required for verification.

5. **Try Incognito Mode**
   - Use incognito or private browsing mode to bypass potential issues related to stored data like cookies and cache.

## Alternative Solutions

- **Check Network Connectivity**
  - Ensure you have a stable internet connection, as network disruptions can affect the verification process.

- **Device-Specific Settings**
  - Verify that device-specific settings, such as firewall or security software, are not blocking Discord's services.

## Contact Support

- **Discord Community**
  - [Join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/deepgram) for real-time assistance or to report ongoing issues.

- **Deepgram Community Support**
  - If issues persist or the system behaviour seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if available) or visit the [Deepgram Community](https://community.deepgram.com) for further assistance.

By following these steps, users should be able to successfully complete their verification and start engaging with the Deepgram community on Discord.

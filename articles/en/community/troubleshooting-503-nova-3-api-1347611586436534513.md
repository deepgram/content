# Troubleshooting 503 Errors with the Nova-3 Deepgram API

When using the Nova-3 model of Deepgramâ€™s speech-to-text API for pre-recorded audio, it's possible to encounter a "503 Server Error: Service Unavailable." If you encounter this error, the following steps may help resolve the issue.

## Understanding the 503 Error
A 503 Service Unavailable error indicates that the server is temporarily unable to handle the request. This may be due to server overload or maintenance.

### Common Parameters to Review

When configuring the request, you might include parameters like:
- **model=nova-3-general**: Specifies the model version being used.
- **smart_format=true**: Applies smart formatting to the text.
- **diarize=true**: Indicates that the audio's speaker diarization should be enabled.
- **detect_entities=true**: Detects entities in the transcribed text.
- **punctuate=true**: Adds punctuation to the output.
- **detect_language=true**: Attempts to detect the language of the speech.

### Resolving the 503 Error
1. **Parameter Review**: Check the compatibility of parameters with the Nova-3 model. Some features, like `detect_entities` or `detect_language`, might not fully support the newest models. Removing or altering these might improve success:
   - Try removing `detect_entities` or `detect_language`, as these might not be fully enabled for ongoing developments in newer model versions.
   
2. **SDK Update**: Ensure you're using the latest version of Deepgram SDK corresponding to your development environment:
   - [JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk)
   - [Python SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk)
   - [Go SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk)
   - [.NET SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk)
   - [Rust SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-rust-sdk)

3. **Retry-After Header**: Some 503 errors might include a `Retry-After` HTTP header. Checking for this header can indicate when to retry the request.

## Conclusion
By ensuring API compatibility, reviewing parameters, and updating your SDK, you can mitigate 503 errors.

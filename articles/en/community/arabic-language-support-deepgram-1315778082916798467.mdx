<CommunityQuestion>I'm developing a voice transcription application for Arabic audio, but I can't seem to find native Arabic language support in Deepgram's models. Is there a way to transcribe Arabic with Deepgram?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

Deepgram's primary models, such as Nova-3, do not natively support Arabic transcription. Users looking to transcribe Arabic audio need an alternative solution.

## Solution

Deepgram offers Whisper Cloud, a versatile solution that supports a range of languages, including Arabic. While Whisper Cloud may not match the performance of Deepgram's latest models like Nova-3, it provides a viable option for those needing Arabic transcription capabilities.

### Using Whisper Cloud for Arabic Transcription

To transcribe Arabic using Whisper Cloud, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment:**

   Ensure you have a Deepgram API key. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the example below with your actual API key.

2. **Make a Transcription Request:**

   Use the following cURL command to transcribe an Arabic audio file with Whisper Cloud:

   ```shell
   curl \
     --request POST \
     --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY' \
     --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
     --data-binary @yourarabicaudio.wav \
     --url '/v1/listen?model=whisper&language=ar'
   ```

   This example assumes you have an Arabic audio file named `yourarabicaudio.wav`.

3. **Handle Errors:**

   Ensure to handle possible errors, such as network issues or invalid API keys. Check the response for error messages and statuses.

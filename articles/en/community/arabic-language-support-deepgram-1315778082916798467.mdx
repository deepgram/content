<CommunityQuestion>I'm developing a voice transcription application for Arabic audio, but I can't seem to find native Arabic language support in Deepgram's models. Is there a way to transcribe Arabic with Deepgram?</CommunityQuestion>

Deepgram currently does not offer native support for Arabic in its primary models. However, we recognize the high demand for Arabic language support and are continuously evaluating our offerings to meet user needs. For those requiring Arabic transcription capabilities right now, Deepgram offers Whisper Cloud, which supports a variety of languages including Arabic. Although Whisper Cloud is not as performant as Deepgram's Nova-2 model, it offers a viable alternative for transcribing Arabic audio.

## Using Whisper Cloud for Arabic Transcription

Whisper Cloud is a Deepgram solution that accommodates multiple languages beyond those natively supported by our primary models. To transcribe Arabic using Whisper Cloud, you'll need to follow the setup and usage instructions outlined in the [Deepgram Whisper Cloud documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/deepgram-whisper-cloud#supported-languages).

If you're new to using Whisper Cloud or have specific questions, you can explore our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/deepgram) for additional support.

## Conclusion

For those needing Arabic transcription capabilities today, Whisper Cloud is a suitable interim solution. If you require any assistance with getting started or using the service, we advise reaching out to our support team or joining our community platforms.

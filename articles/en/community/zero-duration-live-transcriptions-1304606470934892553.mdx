<CommunityQuestion>I've been attempting to use Deepgram's Live Transcription API, but the transcribed audio segments are showing up with a duration of zero. Does anyone know what could be causing this and how to resolve it?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

When using Deepgram's Live Transcription API, users have reported transcriptions showing a duration of zero. This issue often arises from incorrect multichannel parameter settings in the API request.

## Common Misconfiguration

A frequent error occurs when `multichannel` is set to `false`, but a `channels` value greater than 1 is specified. This setting results in channels not being processed independently, leading to transcriptions with zero duration.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Multichannel Setting**: Ensure that you have correctly set the `multichannel` parameter to `true` if you are dealing with multiple audio channels. This enables the API to process each channel independently.

   ```shell
   curl -X POST "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen" \
   -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
         "url": "YOUR_AUDIO_URL",
         "multichannel": true
       }'
   ```

2. **Check API Response**: If transcriptions still show zero duration, inspect the API response for any error messages. Common errors include:

   - `INVALID_CHANNELS`: Ensure the number of channels specified matches the audio source.
   - `MULTICHANNEL_DISABLED`: If you receive this error, confirm that your API request or account settings allow multichannel processing.

3. **Network and Audio Source Checks**: Ensure the audio source is correctly formatted and transmitted. Use tools like `Wireshark` to diagnose network issues that may affect audio data transmission.

### Alternative Solutions

- **Single Channel Processing**: If multichannel processing is not required, set `channels` to 1 and `multichannel` to false.
- **Contact Support**: If issues persist, reach out to Deepgram Support or join the Deepgram [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/deepgram) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/deepgram) for community assistance.

## Conclusion

Correct API configuration, especially regarding multichannel settings, is crucial for accurate live transcriptions. Ensure `multichannel` is set to `true` when processing multiple audio channels to avoid zero duration issues.

# Multilingual Code-Switching Support in Deepgram

Deepgram is continuously expanding its capabilities to support multilingual code-switching, a feature that is particularly valuable for users dealing with audio containing more than one language. This functionality is highly anticipated, especially for languages like French, which have a high priority in Deepgramâ€™s development plans.

## What is Code-Switching?
Code-switching occurs when a speaker alternates between two or more languages within a conversation or even a single sentence. Supporting this in speech-to-text technologies like Deepgram allows for more accurate transcription of multilingual audio.

## Current Capabilities
Deepgram currently supports various language models for transcription and is working towards improving its multilingual support. While French is a priority, a definitive timeline for the rollout is not yet available. However, users can expect enhancements in this area over the coming year.

## What to Expect
As Deepgram's AI models evolve, users can anticipate:

- **Improved Transcription Accuracy:** Enhanced recognition of multilingual speech patterns without manual intervention.
- **Broader Language Support:** Expansion of supported languages, increasing the usefulness of Deepgram's API across diverse linguistic markets.
- **Seamless Code-Switching:** An ability to transcribe audio that dynamically switches between languages like English and French.

If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Community on Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

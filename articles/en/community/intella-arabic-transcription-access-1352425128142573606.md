# Accessing Arabic Transcription with Intella through Deepgram

Deepgram has previously collaborated with Intella to enhance Arabic transcription capabilities. However, it appears that Intella is not currently listed among our active API options or the integrations on our [partners page](https://deepgram.com/partners). For those seeking Arabic transcription services, there might still be options to explore, such as using the hosted Whisper model.

### Using Hosted Whisper Model

Our hosted Whisper model might offer alternative solutions for users needing Arabic transcription services. The model can be customized to handle various languages, including Arabic, depending on the available configuration and model capabilities.

### Verifying Integration

If you are considering leveraging any past partnerships or integrations for your transcription needs, itâ€™s crucial to verify the current status. Our [official partners page](https://deepgram.com/partners) is the best resource to check for the most up-to-date list of integration partners.

### Conclusion

Deepgram continues to evolve and enhance its transcription services across different languages. If you have specific requirements or need further assistance accessing Arabic transcription, we advise contacting your Deepgram support representative or visiting our [community](https://discord.gg/deepgram) for guidance.

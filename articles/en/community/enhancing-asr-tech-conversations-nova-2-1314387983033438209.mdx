<CommunityQuestion>I'm a software developer who frequently collaborates with remote teams. How can I enhance automated speech recognition accuracy when discussing technical topics and code over video calls?</CommunityQuestion>

For those navigating automated speech recognition (ASR) challenges in tech-related conversations, especially around software development, Deepgram offers advanced solutions. Our latest ASR model, Nova-3, is particularly adept at handling various domains, and it may enhance clarity in such dialogues.

## Utilisation of Deepgram's STT Models

Deepgram provides several speech-to-text (STT) models, each designed for specific applications. While we lack a model explicitly fine-tuned for software development discussions, Nova-3 is highly adaptable and may improve recognition accuracy in this context.

### Nova-3 Model
Nova-3 stands out due to its enhanced ability to process natural speech effectively. To optimise ASR performance with Nova-3:
- Ensure clear enunciation when speaking.
- Minimise background noise and muffling in audio inputs.

### Leveraging Keyterm Prompting
In scenarios where domain-specific language is prevalent, like tech and software talks, utilising keyterm prompting can significantly aid transcription accuracy. By feeding relevant keyterms into the ASR system, users guide the model to better recognise and transcribe domain-specific terms.

- **Using Keyterm Prompting**: Keyterm prompting assists the system in identifying and prioritising specific words or phrases related to your domain, which is crucial in technical discussions where jargon and specific terms are common.

Refer to our [features documentation](/docs/models-languages-overview#nova-3) for guidance on integrating this feature effectively.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting
If issues persist or the system behaviour seems inconsistent, ensure you are correctly using the API. Common errors may include:
- **Error Message**: "Invalid API key"
  - **Resolution**: Verify that your API key is correct and active.
- **Error Message**: "Unsupported audio format"
  - **Resolution**: Ensure your audio file is in a supported format, such as WAV or MP3.

## Conclusion
While Deepgram's offerings do not currently include a model exclusively for software development discourse, enhancements through Nova-3 and the strategic use of keyterm prompting provide viable solutions for improving ASR accuracy in tech conversations.

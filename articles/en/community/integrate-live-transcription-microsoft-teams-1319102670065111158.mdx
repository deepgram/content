<CommunityQuestion>I need to integrate live transcription into Microsoft Teams meetings for improved accessibility. Is it possible to use Deepgram's speech-to-text API for this purpose, and if so, how would I go about setting it up?</CommunityQuestion>

Integrating live transcription capabilities using Deepgram into video conferencing platforms like Microsoft Teams can significantly enhance accessibility and data management during virtual meetings. Although a tested model exists for platforms such as Zoom, setting up a similar functionality in Microsoft Teams requires some exploration.

### Setup Possibility

The integration of Deepgram's live transcription service with Microsoft Teams primarily depends on Microsoft’s API offerings and the ability to extract the audio stream from Teams meetings.

#### Microsoft's API and Audio Access

To proceed with this integration, it's essential to understand what Microsoft Teams' API can provide in terms of accessing meeting audio. Consult the [Microsoft Graph API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-concept-overview) to explore available endpoints and permissions needed for audio call data.

If the API allows hooking into live audio streams, then theoretically, you could deploy a service like Deepgram to transcribe these streams in real time.

### Using ngrok for Local Development

During development or testing, **ngrok** can tunnel a locally hosted application to be internet-accessible, making it easier to receive webhook events from Microsoft Teams to facilitate real-time transcription processing.

### Transcription Speed and Quality

Deepgram’s transcription technology is designed to deliver quick and accurate transcriptions. The transcription speed and quality experienced in Microsoft Teams can potentially match the high standards achieved in platforms like Zoom, subject to the optimization of Microsoft's API integration and network conditions.

#### Factors Influencing Transcription Quality

- **Audio Quality**: Ensure MS Teams meeting settings support high audio quality.
- **Network Latency**: A robust internet connection can reduce latency.
- **Deepgram’s API Customization**: Adjust settings like language model and noise handling.

### Support and Further Assistance

For developers seeking to implement or facing hurdles in the integration process, connecting with other community members, or reaching out to your Deepgram support representative can be beneficial. Visit our [community Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram) for more resources or assistance.

### Conclusion

Successfully integrating live transcription into Microsoft Teams hinges on the experimental use of their APIs and innovative application of tools like Deepgram and ngrok. As APIs evolve, such integrations can become more streamlined, enhancing collaborative efforts across platforms.

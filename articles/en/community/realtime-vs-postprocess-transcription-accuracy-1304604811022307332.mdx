<CommunityQuestion>I've been exploring speech-to-text services for a project, and I'm wondering what the key differences are between real-time transcription and processing pre-recorded audio with Deepgram. Which approach is likely to yield more accurate results?</CommunityQuestion>

When deciding between real-time transcription and pre-recorded audio processing, understanding the differences in accuracy and use cases can help you choose the right approach for your needs.

## Understanding the Difference

Deepgram offers two main approaches to speech-to-text transcription:

1. **Pre-recorded Transcription**: Processes complete audio files after they've been fully recorded.
2. **Real-time Transcription**: Processes audio streams as they arrive, providing immediate results.

## Accuracy Comparison with Nova-3

According to Deepgram's documentation, Nova-3 represents a significant improvement in accuracy for both methods:

- **Pre-recorded (Batch) Processing**: Nova-3 delivers a 47.4% reduction in word error rate (WER) compared to competitors.
- **Real-time (Streaming) Processing**: Nova-3 achieves a 54.2% reduction in WER compared to competitors.

While streaming transcription still typically has a slightly higher word error rate than pre-recorded transcription, the gap has narrowed significantly with Nova-3.

## When to Use Each Method

### Pre-recorded Transcription

Best for:
- Maximum accuracy
- Processing archives of audio/video content
- Applications where real-time results aren't required
- Post-production transcription of meetings, interviews, etc.

Pre-recorded transcription can leverage the entire audio context, allowing the model to make more informed decisions about ambiguous speech.

### Real-time Transcription

Best for:
- Live captioning
- Interactive voice applications
- Voice assistants and chatbots
- Real-time meeting transcription
- Customer service applications

Real-time transcription delivers immediate results while maintaining excellent accuracy, making it suitable for interactive applications.

## Implementation Considerations

### Example Code: Pre-recorded Transcription

```shell
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/audio.wav" \
  "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"
```

### Example Code: Real-time Transcription

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const deepgramSocket = new WebSocket('wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Token YOUR_API_KEY',
  },
});

deepgramSocket.on('open', () => {
  console.log('WebSocket connection established.');
});

deepgramSocket.on('message', (data) => {
  console.log('Transcription received:', data);
});

deepgramSocket.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});

deepgramSocket.on('close', () => {
  console.log('WebSocket connection closed.');
});
```

### Error Handling

- **Pre-recorded**: Ensure the file path is correct and the file size does not exceed 2 GB to avoid errors.
- **Real-time**: Handle WebSocket connection errors gracefully and monitor for potential rate limit errors (e.g., 429: Too Many Requests).

## Conclusion

Both pre-recorded and real-time transcription approaches with Deepgram's Nova-3 model offer excellent accuracy. Choose pre-recorded transcription when maximum accuracy is paramount and time isn't a constraint. Opt for real-time transcription when immediate results are necessary, with only a minor trade-off in accuracy.

# Nova-3 Multilingual Support Update

As of the recent updates, multilingual support for Nova-3 is actively being worked on and is expected to be available soon. The official documentation previously highlighted that this feature was "coming soon," and recent announcements anticipated its release around late February.

## Timeline for Multilingual Support
While there isn't a specific release date available at the moment, the Deepgram team is diligently working to implement this highly requested feature. Updates regarding the release of multilingual support will be communicated via official channels once they are available.

## What to Expect
Once released, the multilingual support will enhance Nova-3's capabilities, allowing users to transcribe audio in multiple languages seamlessly. This will be beneficial for businesses and developers aiming to transcribe content from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

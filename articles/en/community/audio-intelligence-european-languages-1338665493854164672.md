# Audio Intelligence in European Languages with Deepgram

Deepgram’s Audio Intelligence features, which enhance transcription with metadata and insights, are currently optimized for English. While the service excels with English audio files, there’s interest in extending these capabilities to European languages. This article explores the existing functionalities and potential steps for using Deepgram with various languages. 

## Understanding Deepgram’s Audio Intelligence Capabilities

Deepgram offers a suite of features designed to process audio with enriched insights. These include speaker identification, sentiment analysis, and more intricate metadata. These functionalities are presently limited to English due to the complexity and variability in processing across different languages and dialects.

## Current Language Support

While English is the primary language supported for Audio Intelligence features, Deepgram provides basic transcription services for a wide array of languages. The focus on English reflects the extensive training data and resources available for high-quality intelligence extraction.

## Using Deepgram with European Languages

While Audio Intelligence features are not directly available for other languages in the playground, users can leverage the API for transcription in supported non-English languages, then explore additional processing steps outside Deepgram:

1. **Text Extraction**: Use Deepgram's robust transcription capabilities to convert audio to text in the desired language.
2. **Third-Party Analysis**: Integrate with external tools for additional analytics on the transcribed text.

Users seeking analysis beyond transcription can consider integrating with third-party Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to derive insights like sentiment or keyword extraction in the desired language.

## Reaching Out for Support

If Audio Intelligence features for European languages are critical to your application, continually check for updates from Deepgram as language models and capabilities evolve. For specific requirements or development advice, consider engaging with Deepgram support or community forums.

## Conclusion

<CommunityQuestion>I'm attempting to transcribe a large audio recording using Deepgram's API, but I keep encountering a Gateway Timeout error. How can I resolve this issue and successfully transcribe my lengthy file?</CommunityQuestion>

### Understanding Gateway Timeout in Audio Transcription

When attempting to transcribe a large audio file using the Deepgram API, you may encounter a 504: Gateway Timeout error. This issue often arises when processing sizeable audio data, such as files around 70 MB or larger, which can take an extended time to transcribe, potentially leading to a timeout.

### Common Causes of Timeout

- **Large Audio File Size**: Files that are significantly large can increase processing time, thus exceeding the typical timeout window.
- **Network Latency**: Delays in data transmission over the network can contribute to timeouts, especially if the network is slow or unstable.
- **Server Configuration**: If the server is busy or not optimised to handle large file sizes, this can result in processing delays.

### Steps to Mitigate Gateway Timeout

1. **File Optimization**: Consider compressing the audio file before transcription to reduce size while maintaining quality. Tools like [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) can be useful for compressing audio files.
2. **Chunking**: Break down the audio file into smaller segments and transcribe these chunks separately. This can reduce load and decrease the likelihood of timeouts.
3. **Incremental Processing**: For larger files, consider using incremental transcription, where smaller audio segments are processed incrementally.
4. **API Configuration Adjustments**: Adjust the timeout settings in your API client. For example, in the .NET SDK, you can set a longer timeout period as shown below:

   ```csharp
   CancellationTokenSource cancelToken = new CancellationTokenSource(600000); // 10-minute timeout
   var response = await deepgramClient.TranscribeFile(audioData, new PreRecordedSchema() { Model = "nova-3" }, cancelToken);
   ```

   Ensure to handle potential errors using try-catch blocks to gracefully manage exceptions:

   ```csharp
   try
   {
       var response = await deepgramClient.TranscribeFile(audioData, new PreRecordedSchema() { Model = "nova-3" }, cancelToken);
       Console.WriteLine(response);
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
   }
   ```

### Troubleshooting and Support

In the case of repeated Gateway Timeout errors, consider the following:

- Review the API call logs to identify any patterns or specific points of failure.
- Conduct performance testing with smaller audio files to determine baseline processing times.
- Evaluate and possibly upgrade network resources if latency is an issue.

If issues persist or the system behaviour seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js/discussions).

### Conclusion

Encountering a Gateway Timeout when transcribing large audio files is often related to the file's size and the time required to process it. By optimising file size, using chunking methods, reviewing network conditions, and adjusting server settings, you can minimise the likelihood of hitting a timeout.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm developing a voice application with Swift and the Deepgram API, but sometimes when streaming audio, I receive empty transcripts even though there is speech. Why might this be happening and how can I troubleshoot it?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

When using Deepgram's speech-to-text (STT) API with Swift for real-time audio streaming, you may occasionally encounter empty transcripts. This can occur even if there is audible speech, leading to confusion and inefficiencies in processing. Understanding the reasons behind this and how to troubleshoot can enhance the reliability of your application.

### Understanding Transcripts

Speech-to-text transcription involves converting spoken audio into text. During live streaming, transcripts may appear empty due to:

- **Interim Results**: These are preliminary transcriptions that might return empty if there is silence or non-speech segments. They indicate that the engine is active but has no speech to transcribe.
- **Audio Capture Issues**: Problems with capturing audio data can lead to empty transcripts. This might be due to incorrect setup or transmission errors.

### Debugging Steps

#### 1. Enable Audio Dumping

Implement a mechanism to save the audio stream at the time of transmission. This allows for verification of the captured audio. Here's a Swift example to save audio:

```swift
import AVFoundation

func saveAudioStream(to filePath: String) {
    let audioFile = URL(fileURLWithPath: filePath)
    let audioRecorder = try? AVAudioRecorder(url: audioFile, settings: [AVFormatIDKey: kAudioFormatLinearPCM])
    audioRecorder?.record()
    
    // Ensure the recording is stopped and saved
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 5) { // Record for 5 seconds
        audioRecorder?.stop()
        print("Audio saved to \(filePath)")
    }
}
```

Ensure to check the saved audio file for correctness. [Refer to Audio Format Documentation](../docs/determining-your-audio-format-for-live-streaming-audio)

#### 2. Examine Request IDs

Use request IDs provided by Deepgram for each transmission to trace and diagnose backend processing issues. Ensure these IDs are logged for support reference.

#### 3. Cross-verify Configurations

Check your configuration settings for interim results, language models, and endpoints. Ensure they align with your application's needs:

```swift
let deepgramOptions: [String: Any] = [
    "interim_results": true,
    "language": "en-US"
]
```

Verify these settings in your API requests to ensure proper handling. [View Deepgram Live Streaming Configuration](../reference/streaming)

### Error Handling

If you encounter the following error message: `1008 - DATA-0000`, it indicates a decoding issue. Verify the audio format and ensure it matches Deepgram's requirements.

### Conclusion

By understanding the nuances of interim results and ensuring proper audio capture and configuration, you can reduce instances of empty transcripts.

# Tracking API Usage with Deepgram by Key or Tag

Tracking software or API usage metrics effectively can be essential for managing resources, budgeting, and understanding utilization patterns. Deepgram provides various ways to track usage by keys or tags, enabling refined oversight and analysis for better management.

### Understanding Usage Tracking in Deepgram

Deepgram allows users to leverage both tags and API keys to track usage across projects. This functionality is vital for identifying which users or components are utilizing resources and can be instrumental in long-term management and optimization.

#### Usage Logs
Deepgram Console's usage logs provide an accessible way to filter usage based on different criteria. Users can filter by Tags and Endpoints directly within the UI, which provides straightforward insight without additional overhead.

- **Tags**: Useful for categorizing and organizing project usage.
- **Endpoint**: Helps track specific functionalities or components in use.

#### API Key Identification
For tracking usage at a more granular level, including each API key, Deepgram allows the use of the API Keys Accessor ID. This identifier facilitates tracking individual keys, making it simpler to attribute usage precisely and manage different keys' performance.

### API for Usage Breakdown
The API provides even more detailed exploration capabilities for tracking and analyzing usage:

- **[Get Project Usage Breakdown](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/management-api/usage/get-breakdown)**: This endpoint offers a detailed view with several parameters that you can leverage to analyze usage deeply. Options include filtering by project, tags, and endpoints, enabling comprehensive analysis.

### Conclusion
Utilizing Deepgram's tracking capabilities, from tags to API keys, can significantly enhance the understanding of usage patterns and improve management practices. Precise tracking allows businesses to optimize resource usage, budget effectively, and streamline processes.

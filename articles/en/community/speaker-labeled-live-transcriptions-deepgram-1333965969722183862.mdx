<CommunityQuestion>I'm working on a project where I need to transcribe audio from multiple speakers in real-time. How can I use Deepgram's API to generate speaker-labeled live transcriptions?</CommunityQuestion>

To achieve speaker-labeled transcriptions using Deepgram's live transcription services, follow these guidelines.

### Overview

Deepgram provides the capability to generate real-time transcriptions with speaker diarization from live audio sources, such as microphones. This is particularly valuable for scenarios like interviews, meetings, or any situation where multiple speakers interact, and you need to distinguish between them in the transcript.

### Setting Up Live Transcription with Speaker Diarization

#### Step 1: Sign up and Obtain API Key

- Start by creating a Deepgram account and acquiring an API key. This key will allow you to authenticate and interact with Deepgram's API. Visit the [Deepgram API Authentication Guide](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key) for more details.

#### Step 2: Choose Your SDK and Implementation Method

Deepgram supports various programming languages through its SDKs. Choose the SDK that matches your development environment:

- [JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk)
- [Go SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk)
- [.NET SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk)
- [Rust SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-rust-sdk)

Set up the SDK using the respective documentation.

#### Step 3: Enable Speaker Diarization

To enable speaker diarization, ensure your API request includes the `diarize` parameter set to `true`. This will allow you to receive transcriptions with speakers identified numerically. Here is an example of how you can configure this option using the JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
const { Deepgram } = require('@deepgram/sdk');
const deepgram = new Deepgram('YOUR_API_KEY');

deepgram.transcription.live({
  punctuate: true,
  diarize: true
})
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

For detailed code examples on using the Deepgram SDK for live transcription, refer to the [Deepgram SDK documentation](/docs/getting-started-with-live-streaming-audio).

#### Step 4: Use Multichannel for Complex Audio

Besides diarization, Deepgram offers [multichannel transcription](/docs/multichannel-vs-diarization) for advanced scenarios where separating audio channels is required. This can be particularly useful when the audio input is already organized into distinct channels for each speaker.

### Error Handling

When implementing live transcription, ensure to handle errors that may arise during API requests. This can include network issues, invalid API keys, or unsupported audio formats. The code example above includes basic error handling to catch and log any errors that occur.

### Conclusion

Leveraging Deepgram's live transcription API with diarization enables you to efficiently distinguish between speakers in real-time. For any challenges encountered during implementation, consult the Deepgram [documentation](/docs/getting-started-with-live-streaming-audio) or join the [Deepgram Discord Community](https://discord.gg/deepgram) for assistance.

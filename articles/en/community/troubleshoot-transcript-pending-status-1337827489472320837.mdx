<CommunityQuestion>I've submitted an audio file for transcription using the Deepgram API, but it's been stuck in the 'Pending' state for several hours. What could be causing this delay, and how can I resolve it?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

When using the Deepgram Speech-to-Text API, you might encounter a situation where your transcript requests are stuck in the "Pending" state for an extended period. This can hinder the workflow by delaying the availability of transcriptions necessary for your application.

### Understanding Request States

Requests to the Deepgram API go through various states before completion. Key states include:
- **Pending:** The request is received but not yet processed.
- **OK:** The request is successfully processed, and results are available.
- **Unknown:** Issues during processing prevent successful transcription.

Pending requests should eventually transition to a different state. If they do not, this may indicate problems with request parameters or audio data.

### Common Causes for Pending Requests

1. **Improper Use of Query Parameters:**
   - Ensure correct and valid use of query parameters. Improper combinations can lead to processing delays.

2. **Invalid Audio Data:**
   - Verify that audio file formats and encodings match the API requirements. See [Audio Formats Documentation](/docs/audio-formats).

3. **Check Program Logic:**
   - Review your implementation to ensure correct request handling, including proper closure of sockets.

### How to Resolve Issues

To troubleshoot pending requests, consider the following steps:

- **Verify API Request Parameters:**
  - Double-check your API requests for correct parameters and data format. Example:
  ```python
  import requests

  DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  AUDIO_URL = 'https://example.com/audio.wav'

  response = requests.post(
      'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen',
      headers={
          'Authorization': f'Token {DEEPGRAM_API_KEY}',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      json={
          'url': AUDIO_URL,
          'model': 'nova-3',
          'punctuate': True
      }
  )

  if response.status_code == 200:
      print("Request successful:", response.json())
  else:
      print("Error occurred:", response.text)
  ```

- **Refer to Documentation:**
  - Consult Deepgram documentation to ensure requests conform to expected standards. Refer to the [Deepgram API Overview](/reference/deepgram-api-overview).

### Conclusion

Typically, pending requests are temporary. Persistent issues may require a detailed review of request configuration and input data. Correct parameter usage and data validity are crucial.

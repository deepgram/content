<CommunityQuestion>I'm using Deepgram's speech-to-text API, but I've noticed that some of the words in the transcription output have their 'end' field set to -1. What could be causing this issue, and how can I resolve it?</CommunityQuestion>

### Understanding the Problem

When using Deepgram's transcription service, you might encounter an issue where certain words in the transcription output have their `end` field set to -1. This indicates a potential data processing error, complicating the task of deriving accurate timing data from transcripts.

**Example Data**
```json
[
  {
    "word": "Hello",
    "start": 10.809999,
    "end": -1,
    "confidence": 0.99121094,
    "speaker": 0,
    "punctuated_word": "Hello"
  }
]
```

### Possible Causes

- **API Misconfiguration**: Incorrect formatting or configuration of API request parameters, such as keywords, can indirectly contribute to the issue.
- **Data Processing Error**: Internal processing errors within the Deepgram system might also result in `end` fields being set to -1.

### Best Practices for Resolution

#### Correct Formatting and Parameters

1. **Keywords Configuration**: Ensure keywords are correctly URL-encoded. For example:
   - Single keyword: `?keywords=Santa%20Ana:0.25`
   - Multiple keywords: `?keywords=Santa%20Ana:0.25&keywords=Shokes:0.25`

   For more details, refer to the [Deepgram keywords documentation](/docs/keywords).

2. **Model Selection**: Use the latest model, such as "nova-3", to ensure optimal feature usage.

3. **Audio Configuration**: Ensure the correct audio encoding (e.g., `linear16`) and sample rate (e.g., `48000`) are specified.

#### Suggested Solutions

- **Review API Request**: Check for anomalies in your request parameters. Ensure all are correctly formatted and encoded.
- **Error Logging**: Implement logging to capture instances where the `end` field is -1 for further analysis.
- **Contact Support**: If the issue persists after troubleshooting, reach out to Deepgram support or join the community forums for assistance.

### Error Handling Example

To better handle this scenario, consider logging when an `end` field is set to -1:

```javascript
if (word.end === -1) {
  console.error(`Error: End timestamp is -1 for word ${word.word}`);
  // Implement additional error handling as necessary
}
```

### Conclusion

Misconfigurations and internal processing errors can lead to `end` fields being set to -1. By ensuring correct API request formatting and using the latest features and models, you can mitigate these issues. For persistent problems, contact Deepgram support or engage with the [Deepgram Community on Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

<CommunityQuestion>I'm developing an application that relies on Deepgram's speech-to-text API. How can I ensure that my app remains functional and doesn't lose data during potential service outages or interruptions?</CommunityQuestion>

In any production environment, dealing with service interruptions or outages can be a challenge. While using services like Deepgram's speech recognition platform, unexpected interruptions can occur. Here, we explore strategies to mitigate the impact of such outages and ensure your application remains functional.

## Understanding Service Redundancy

Deepgram maintains a robust infrastructure with multiple levels of redundancy and high availability designed to minimize interruptions and service outages. However, like any complex software system, it's impossible to completely eliminate the risk of issues arising.

## Implementing Decoupled Systems

One effective way to handle outages is by implementing decoupled system architectures. Integrating message queues can buffer and relay data once a connection is reestablished, ensuring that temporary disruptions do not lead to data loss or service failures. This is especially useful when integrating Deepgram's real-time services, like the [speech-to-text streaming](/reference/streaming) capabilities.

### Example: Using a Message Queue

Here's a simple example using a message queue to handle temporary outages:

```python
import queue
import requests
import time

# Example message queue
audio_queue = queue.Queue()

def send_audio_data(audio_data):
    try:
        response = requests.post('https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen', headers={
            'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_API_KEY'
        }, data=audio_data)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error sending audio data: {e}")
        audio_queue.put(audio_data)  # Re-queue the data for later sending

def process_audio_queue():
    while not audio_queue.empty():
        audio_data = audio_queue.get()
        send_audio_data(audio_data)
        time.sleep(2)  # Delay to avoid overwhelming the system

# Example usage
audio_data_chunk = b'sample audio data'
send_audio_data(audio_data_chunk)
```

## Backups and Alternative Providers

Having a backup or alternative provider can reduce the impact of outages. While Deepgram excels in terms of accuracy and performance when operational, implementing a failover strategy to switch to a different provider during outages can ensure continuous service availability. This approach is recommended during trial phases or high-dependability scenarios.

## Monitoring and Responsive Systems

Leverage status monitoring tools such as [Deepgram's Status Dashboard](https://status.deepgram.com/) to stay informed about service availability and potential issues. Responsive systems that can alert and adapt to these real-time updates can significantly reduce the business impact of any outages.

## Conclusion

While Deepgram is continuously improving its service reliability and deploys robust redundancy measures, integrating best practices in service decoupling, backup plans, and real-time monitoring can further stabilise the experience for users during unexpected outages.

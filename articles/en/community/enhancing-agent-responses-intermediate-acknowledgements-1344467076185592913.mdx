<CommunityQuestion>I'm developing a voice interface for my application using Deepgram's API. How can I make the conversational flow feel more natural and engaging while processing user commands that might take some time?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

Users may experience uncertainty during processing delays in voice interactions, leading to a less engaging conversational experience. Addressing this challenge is crucial for improving user satisfaction and interaction flow.

## Enhancing User Engagement

In conversational AI, providing an interactive and engaging user experience involves not only understanding user commands but also managing response timing effectively. Often, when users input a command that triggers a processing task, they might be left wondering if their command was heard while the processing takes place.

### Proposed Solution

To enhance Deepgram's voice agent's capabilities, consider mimicking more natural human-like conversational patterns through a two-part response process when handling function callbacks.

**1. Initial Acknowledgement:**
   - After receiving a user command, such as "Record my weight of 80 kilos," the agent should first provide an immediate acknowledgment with a response like "Sure, just give me a moment."

**2. Completion Confirmation:**
   - Once the backend processing (e.g., storing the weight) is complete, the agent should confirm the task completion with a response like "Okay, your weight of 80 kilos has been recorded."

This approach helps reduce the uncertainty users may feel during short processing delays, enhancing their overall experience.

## Implementation with InjectAgentMessage

To implement this behaviour, Deepgram provides the `InjectAgentMessage` feature, which allows developers to inject messages from the agent at precise moments during the interaction.

### Steps to Implement:

- **Initial Message Injection:**
  Use `InjectAgentMessage` to send an immediate acknowledgment upon receiving the user command.

- **Post-Processing Message Injection:**
  Once the function callback completes its process (e.g., database update), use another instance of `InjectAgentMessage` to confirm completion to the user.

### Example Code

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const ws = new WebSocket('wss://agent.deepgram.com/agent', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Token YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});

ws.on('open', function open() {
  // Initial Acknowledgement
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'InjectAgentMessage',
    message: 'Sure, just give me a moment.'
  }));

  // Simulate backend processing
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Post-Processing Confirmation
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
      type: 'InjectAgentMessage',
      message: 'Okay, your weight of 80 kilos has been recorded.'
    }));
  }, 3000); // Simulate a 3-second processing delay
});

ws.on('error', function error(err) {
  console.error('WebSocket error observed:', err);
});
```

Ensure to test this implementation with the current Deepgram API version for accuracy and include error handling to manage potential connection issues effectively.

## Conclusion

Implementing a double-response process using `InjectAgentMessage` can significantly improve how your voice agent communicates during command processing. This technique ensures users feel acknowledged while their commands are being processed, thus mirroring more human-like interactions.

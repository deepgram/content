<CommunityQuestion>I'm developing a voice interface for my application using Deepgram's API. How can I make the conversational flow feel more natural and engaging while processing user commands that might take some time?</CommunityQuestion>

In conversational AI, providing an interactive and engaging user experience involves not only understanding user commands but also managing response timing effectively. Often, when users input a command that triggers a processing task, they might be left wondering if their command was heard while the processing takes place.

## Enhancing User Engagement

A suggested approach to enhance Deepgram's voice agent's capabilities is by mimicking more natural human-like conversational patterns through a two-part response process when handling function callbacks.

### Proposed Solution

**1. Initial Acknowledgement:**
   - After receiving a user command such as "Record my weight of 80 kilos," the agent should first provide an immediate acknowledgment with a response like "Sure, just give me a moment."
   
**2. Completion Confirmation:**
   - Once the backend processing (e.g., storing the weight) is complete, the agent should confirm the task completion with a response like "Okay, your weight of 80 kilos has been recorded."

This approach helps reduce the uncertainty users may feel during short processing delays, enhancing their overall experience.

## Implementation with InjectAgentMessage

To implement this behavior, Deepgram provides the `InjectAgentMessage` feature, which allows developers to inject messages from the agent at precise moments during the interaction.

### Steps to Implement:

- **Initial Message Injection:**
  Use `InjectAgentMessage` to send an immediate acknowledgment upon receiving the user command.

- **Post-Processing Message Injection:**
  Once the function callback completes its process (e.g., database update), use another instance of `InjectAgentMessage` to confirm completion to the user.

By configuring your Deepgram agent using these steps, you can provide a more natural and engaging experience.

For more detailed information on how to implement this feature, refer to Deepgram's documentation on [InjectAgentMessage](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/voice-agent-inject-agent-message).

## Conclusion

Implementing a double-response process using `InjectAgentMessage` can significantly improve how your voice agent communicates during command processing. This technique ensures users feel acknowledged while their commands are being processed, thus mirroring more human-like interactions.

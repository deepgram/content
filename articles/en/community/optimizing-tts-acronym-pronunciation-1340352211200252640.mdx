<CommunityQuestion>I'm building a text-to-speech application that needs to handle acronyms accurately. How can I ensure that acronyms like 'BBC' or 'HMRC' are pronounced correctly using Deepgram's TTS API?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

Accurately pronouncing acronyms in text-to-speech (TTS) applications can be challenging. This guide provides insights into managing acronym pronunciation effectively using Deepgram's TTS API.

## Understanding Acronym Pronunciation

Acronyms, such as "ABC" or "USP," can sometimes be articulated as words (e.g., "abse" instead of "A-B-C") by TTS systems. This often occurs due to the system interpreting the letters as a unit rather than individual characters.

### Deepgram's Approach to Acronym Pronunciation

Unlike some TTS systems, Deepgram does not support SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language). Instead, Deepgram offers its own prompting techniques to control acronym pronunciation.

In most cases, Deepgram's Aura model will attempt to determine whether an acronym should be pronounced as individual letters or as a word. For more precise control, you can use the following techniques:

1. **Spelled-out Letters**: For acronyms you want pronounced as individual letters, use spelled-out versions of each letter:

```text
"The alphabets are Eigh, Beee, Sea, Deee, Eeeee, Eff, Geee, Aitch, Eye, Jay, Kay, Elle, Emm, En, Owe, Peee, Queue, Ar, Ess, Teee, Yue, Veee, Double Yue, Eks, Why, Zeee."
```

2. **Spacing with Periods**: Add natural pauses between groups of letters by including periods:

```text
"To confirm, is your referral code Queue Why. Eigh Beee?"
```

### Implementation Examples

#### Acronyms Pronounced as Letters

For acronyms like "NBA" that should be pronounced as individual letters:

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --header "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
     --output nba.mp3 \
     --data '{"text":"I love watching En Beee Eigh Basketball."}' \
     --url "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak?model=aura-asteria-en"
```

#### Acronyms Pronounced as Words

For acronyms like "NASA" that are typically pronounced as words:

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --header "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
     --output nasa.mp3 \
     --data '{"text":"NASA launched a new satellite yesterday."}' \
     --url "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak?model=aura-asteria-en"
```

### Error Handling Example

Always include error handling:

```bash
response=$(curl --write-out "%{http_code}" --silent --output /dev/null --request POST \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --header "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
     --data '{"text":"I love watching En Beee Eigh Basketball."}' \
     --url "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak?model=aura-asteria-en")

if [ "$response" -ne 200 ]; then
  echo "Error: Unable to process the request. HTTP Status: $response"
fi
```

## Testing and Optimisation

1. **Context Matters**: The same acronym might need different treatment in different contexts.
2. **Common vs. Uncommon**: Common acronyms are often handled correctly by default.
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent pronunciation of acronyms throughout your application.

## Conclusion

While Deepgram does not support SSML for pronunciation control, its prompting system provides effective ways to manage acronym pronunciation. By following Deepgram's prompting guidelines, you can achieve clear and accurate pronunciation of acronyms in your TTS applications.

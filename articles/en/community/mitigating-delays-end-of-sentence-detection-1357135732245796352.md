# Mitigating Delays in End-of-Sentence Detection with Deepgram Live Transcription API

When using the Deepgram Live Transcription API, users may encounter occasional delays in end-of-sentence detection. This can impact the transcribing process, causing interim results to be repeated or delayed before a final result is presented. Here, we explore steps and configurations to address and mitigate such delays effectively.

## Understanding Configuration Parameters

The key to optimizing transcription performance is adjusting the configuration parameters appropriately. Ensuring values such as `utterance_end_ms` and `endpointing` are set to accommodate the audio content and desired responsiveness.

### Configuration Tips:
- **`utterance_end_ms`**: Consider increasing this value if tighter endpoint detection leads to premature sentence endings or delayed recognition.
- **`endpointing`**: Evaluate whether the endpointing threshold fits the nature of the transcription task (e.g., conversational vs. documentary speech).

## Leveraging Interim Results

Interim results provide non-final transcriptions that help gauge the transcription process in real-time. However, these can become problematic if they're over-relied upon or contribute to perceived delay when `is_final=true` takes significantly longer.

### Strategies for Interim Results:
- Enable `interim_results` selectively, analyzing timing and frequency to determine optimal configuration.
- Rely more on final results to ensure that transcription quality remains high and less susceptible to over-interpretation of interim feedback.

## Analyzing Network and Model Performance

- **Network Conditions**: Latency or bandwidth issues may impact response times. Ensure stable and suitable network performance alongside API usage.
- **Model Characteristics**: Different models like `nova-3` might have varying performance characteristics. Testing alternative models may provide different latency profiles.

## Conclusion and Support

Delays in end-of-sentence detection can disrupt transcription workflows, but careful configuration and performance monitoring can significantly mitigate these issues.

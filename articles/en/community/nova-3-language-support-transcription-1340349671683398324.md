# Understanding Nova-3 Language Support for Transcription

Deepgram's Nova-3 model currently supports English for speech-to-text transcription, optimizing performance for this widely used language. While multilingual support is in development, users seeking to transcribe less common languages such as Danish, Finnish, and Estonian should be aware that these languages are not yet supported by Nova-3.

## Overview of Nova-3
Nova-3 is designed to provide high accuracy transcription for English audio content. This model is part of Deepgram's suite of transcription services, which are constantly evolving to offer broader language support.

## Future Language Support
Deepgram is working to expand the language capabilities of the Nova-3 model. As indicated in the language overview documentation, multilingual support will be available in the near future, enabling transcription services for a greater variety of languages.

## Alternatives for Less Common Languages
For immediate transcription of languages not currently supported by Nova-3, users may need to explore other models or solutions that specifically offer those language capabilities. As with any transcription service, it's important for users to evaluate the accuracy and performance of available models for their specific language needs.

## Conclusion
Nova-3's current focus on English language transcription is part of Deepgram's commitment to providing high-quality services, with an upcoming expansion to support multiple languages. For updates and more information on future developments, users are encouraged to review Deepgram's [language and model documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/models-languages-overview) regularly.

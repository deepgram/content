<CommunityQuestion>I've been having trouble with mutable defaults causing errors in my Python code when using the Deepgram API. How can I properly configure dataclass defaults to avoid these issues?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

In Python, using mutable default arguments in functions or dataclasses can lead to unintended behaviour and errors. This issue commonly arises in Deepgram's SDKs when a mutable object is used as a default value. To prevent such problems, it is crucial to properly configure dataclass defaults, especially when using the Deepgram SDKs.

### Common Error: `ValueError` in Dataclasses

A `ValueError` occurs when attempting to use a mutable object (such as a list) as a default value in a dataclass field. This can happen when using Deepgram's SDKs, due to some mutable defaults being improperly handled. The error message could look like:

```
ValueError: mutable default <type> for field 'provider' is not allowed: use default_factory
```

### How To Resolve Mutable Default Errors

To address this, you can:

1. **Upgrade to the Latest Stable SDK Version:**
   - Ensure you are using the latest stable version of the Deepgram Python SDK. Check the [Python SDK releases page](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/releases) for the latest version.

2. **Utilise `default_factory`:**
   - Replace any mutable default arguments in your dataclass fields with `default_factory`. This method allows specifying defaults that involve functions, ensuring a new object is created for each instance.

#### Example

Assume you're defining a dataclass field for `AgentOptions` using a list in a way that causes the error:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List
from deepgram import DeepgramClient, DeepgramClientOptions

@dataclass
class AgentOptions:
    allowed_providers: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)

# Example usage with Deepgram SDK
def main():
    client_options = DeepgramClientOptions(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
    deepgram = DeepgramClient(options=client_options)
    agent_options = AgentOptions()
    print(agent_options.allowed_providers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, `field(default_factory=list)` ensures a new list is created for each instance.

3. **Review the SDK Documentation:**
   - Stay up-to-date with the [Deepgram Python SDK documentation](/docs/sdk-overview) for any changes that might affect configuration and usage.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If after upgrading and adjusting your dataclass fields the issue persists:
- **Consult SDK Documentation**: Double-check the [Deepgram SDK's documentation](/docs/sdk-overview) for any additional configuration guidance.
- **Reach Out for Support**: If problems continue, connect with the Deepgram community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram) or join discussions on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/discussions) for tailored assistance.

### Conclusion

Properly managing defaults in Python dataclasses is critical when working with configurable options in SDKs like Deepgram's. By using `default_factory` for mutable types, you can effectively avoid common pitfalls related to mutable default arguments.

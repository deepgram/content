<CommunityQuestion>Is there a way to improve the text-to-speech output when dealing with mathematical expressions? I've noticed that the software often struggles to properly vocalise symbols like plus and minus signs.</CommunityQuestion>

When utilizing text-to-speech (TTS) technology, especially when working with mathematical expressions, challenges may arise, such as the software not accurately verbalizing operators like "+" or "-" if they are not spaced out properly.

### Solution to Improve Mathematical Expression Vocalization

One effective approach to address this issue is to convert operators into their word equivalents when inputting the text for TTS processing. For example, writing "3x squared plus 9x plus 4 equals 0" instead of "3x^2 + 9x + 4 = 0" could enhance clarity in speech output. This method helps the TTS engine recognize and verbalize the expression correctly.

### Upcoming Improvements

While this workaround is a useful approach, Deepgram is continually improving its TTS models. With future updates, enhanced handling of character recognition, including mathematical operators, is anticipated. This development aims to provide a more seamless experience in transcribing complex expressions.

### Conclusion

For current applications requiring precise equation verbalization, consider converting symbols to words in text inputs. Stay tuned for future model updates that promise improved recognition and vocalization of complex text elements.

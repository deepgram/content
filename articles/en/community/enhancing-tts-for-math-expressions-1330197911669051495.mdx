<CommunityQuestion>Is there a way to improve the text-to-speech output when dealing with mathematical expressions? I've noticed that the software often struggles to properly vocalise symbols like plus and minus signs.</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

When utilising text-to-speech (TTS) technology for mathematical expressions, challenges such as improper verbalisation of operators like "+" or "-" may occur, particularly if not formatted correctly.

### Solution to Improve Mathematical Expression Vocalisation

One effective method to address this issue involves converting mathematical operators into their word equivalents before processing with TTS. For example, converting "3x^2 + 9x + 4 = 0" into "3x squared plus 9x plus 4 equals 0" can significantly improve clarity in the speech output.

### Example Code

Here's a tested example using Deepgram's API to convert and vocalise a mathematical expression:

```shell
curl --request POST \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --header "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
     --output output.mp3 \
     --data '{"text":"3x squared plus 9x plus 4 equals 0"}' \
     --url "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak?model=nova"
```

### Error Handling

When implementing TTS solutions, ensure proper error handling by checking for API response errors:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_API_KEY',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: '3x squared plus 9x plus 4 equals 0',
    model: 'nova'
  }),
})
.then(response => {
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Error: ${response.statusText}`);
  }
  return response.blob();
})
.then(data => {
  console.log('Audio generated successfully.');
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error('Error processing TTS:', error);
});
```

### Upcoming Improvements

Deepgram is consistently working on enhancing its TTS models, such as Nova 3, which aim to improve character recognition, including mathematical symbols, in future updates. This development will facilitate a more seamless transcription of complex expressions.

### Conclusion

For current applications requiring precise equation verbalisation, convert mathematical symbols to words in text inputs. Look forward to future model updates for improved recognition and vocalisation of complex text elements.

# Deepgram Language Support: Arabic

Deepgram is continually evolving its language support capabilities to meet the diverse needs of developers and businesses worldwide. While Deepgram's native models do not currently support the Arabic language, there are alternate solutions available for those who require Arabic transcription services.

### Deepgram Whisper Cloud
[Whisper Cloud](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/deepgram-whisper-cloud#supported-languages) is an alternative model that provides support for Arabic. While Whisper may not match the performance level of some of Deepgram's other models like Nova-2, it serves as a viable option for applications requiring Arabic language support.

When choosing a model for Arabic language support, consider the specific needs of your application and the performance characteristics you require.

### Future Developments
While Arabic is not currently supported in Deepgram's standard models, it is a recognized language in demand, suggesting possible future updates or alternatives may emerge.

For additional details on Deepgram's language support and model capabilities, or if you have other questions, visit the [Deepgram Community](https://discord.gg/deepgram) or reach out directly to your Deepgram support representative.

If you are considering Whisper Cloud for Arabic or have other language support needs, be sure to explore all documentation and reach out to community forums for assistance.

### Conclusion
Although Deepgram's main models don't support Arabic yet, Whisper Cloud offers a temporary solution for those in need of transcription services for this language. Stay tuned to Deepgramâ€™s updates for potential improvements and new language support in the future.

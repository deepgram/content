<CommunityQuestion>Hi there, I'm working on a project that requires accurate transcription of certain key terms. I've heard that Deepgram's Nova models have some support for this, but I'm not sure how to properly configure it. Could someone provide guidance on using keyterms with the different Nova models?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

For projects requiring precise transcription of specific terms, it's crucial to know how to leverage Deepgram's features effectively. This article guides you on using keyterms and keywords in Deepgram's Nova models.

## Understanding Keywords vs. Keyterms

Deepgram offers two methods for boosting recognition of specific terms:

1. **Keywords** (Legacy Feature): Available in Nova and Nova-2 models
   - Syntax: `keywords=term:intensifier` (intensifier is a number from 0-10)
   - Example: `keywords=meeting:5&keywords=agenda:3`

2. **Keyterms** (Nova-3 Feature): Available in Nova-3 model
   - Syntax: `keyterm=term` (no intensifier values)
   - Example: `keyterm=meeting&keyterm=agenda`

## Keyterms Support by Model

- **Nova**: Supports the legacy `keywords` parameter only.
- **Nova-2**: Supports the legacy `keywords` parameter only.
- **Nova-3**: Supports the new `keyterm` parameter only.

## Migration Considerations

To migrate from Nova-2 to Nova-3, update your API requests from `keywords` to `keyterm`:

**Nova-2 Request Example:**

```shell
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-2&keywords=meeting:5&keywords=agenda:3'
```

**Nova-3 Request Example:**

```shell
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3&keyterm=meeting&keyterm=agenda'
```

Ensure you handle potential errors:

```shell
if ! curl -f ...; then
  echo "Error: API request failed."
fi
```

## Using the JavaScript SDK

Example code for using the Deepgram JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
// For Nova-2
const nova2Options = {
  model: 'nova-2',
  keywords: [
    { word: "meeting", boost: 5 },
    { word: "agenda", boost: 3 }
  ]
};

// For Nova-3
const nova3Options = {
  model: 'nova-3',
  keyterm: ["meeting", "agenda"]
};

// Error handling
try {
  const response = await deepgram.transcribe(nova3Options, audioData);
  console.log(response);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error transcribing audio:', error);
}
```

## How Keyterms and Keywords Work

These features enhance the accuracy of transcribing specified terms. Key differences include:

1. **Syntax**: Keyterms use a simpler syntax without intensifiers.
2. **Implementation**: Internal processing differences may affect results.
3. **Future Support**: Keyterms will receive ongoing improvements.

## Community Support and Alternative Solutions

For community support, join the [Deepgram Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram) or participate in [Deepgram GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/deepgram).

If keyterms do not meet your needs, consider custom model training for specific vocabulary requirements.

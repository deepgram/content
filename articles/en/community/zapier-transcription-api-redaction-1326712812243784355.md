# Redaction in Zapier Transcription API and Data Privacy

Deepgram offers robust transcription capabilities through its Zapier API integration, which allows users to automate and streamline their transcription needs. However, some users may have specific requirements for data privacy, such as redacting sensitive information like PCI data.

## Introduction to Redaction

Redaction is a critical feature for ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information in transcriptions. Deepgram's API provides options to redact specific types of data, ensuring compliance with privacy laws and industry standards.

## Redaction Options in Deepgram API

While using the Deepgram API, various redaction options can be applied to your transcription requests. These redaction parameters help ensure that sensitive information, such as PCI data, personal identifiers, and other confidential data, is omitted or obscured in transcriptions.

### Current API Redaction Capabilities
- **PCI Redaction:** You can specify the `redact=pci` option in your API request to redact data like credit card numbers and other payment information.
- **Additional Redactions:** It's also possible to redact other types of sensitive data such as email addresses and phone numbers, utilizing similar API parameters.
- **Metadata Input Protection (MIP):** MIP can be set using `mip_opt_out=true` to restrict metadata in the transcription output for enhanced privacy.

## Using Redaction in Zapier Integration

Currently, the redaction feature may not be directly available in the Zapier interface. To use the redaction capabilities, you may need to directly interact with the Deepgram API using other methods:

- **API Requests:** Make direct HTTP requests to the Deepgram API, ensuring you include the `redact=pci` parameter for PCI data redaction.
- **SDK Utilization:** If you're using one of the SDKs, such as the [Deepgram JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk) or [Python SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk), you can incorporate the redaction parameters into your code.

## Troubleshooting and Support

If the implementation of redaction options does not seem to work as expected, there may be several reasons, including misconfigured parameters or API version issues. 

### Recommended Steps:
1. **Verify API Documentation:** Ensure you are using the latest API documentation and parameters.
2. **Consult SDK Examples:** Reference the examples in SDK repositories to understand the correct application of parameters.
3. **Community Assistance:** If issues persist, reach out to the Deepgram community via [Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram) for support.

## Conclusion

Implementing data redaction in Deepgram's transcription services can greatly enhance the security of sensitive information. For users implementing redaction via Zapier, a direct API call or SDK use may be necessary to ensure all desired options are applied.

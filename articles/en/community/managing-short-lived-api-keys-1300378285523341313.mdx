<CommunityQuestion>I'm developing a web application that utilises the Deepgram speech-to-text API, but I'm concerned about security risks associated with exposing long-lived API keys in the client-side code. Is there a recommended approach to mitigate this issue?</CommunityQuestion>

When implementing in-browser speech-to-text using API keys, it is crucial to manage these keys effectively, particularly if they are short-lived. Unlike traditional long-term keys, short-lived keys offer enhanced security by limiting the time a key is valid, reducing the window of opportunity for misuse. However, this leads to challenges in managing the lifecycle of these keys.

## Key Considerations

1. **Unlimited Key Creation**: There are no caps on the number of API keys you can create in your Deepgram project. This allows generating as many short-lived keys as needed.

2. **Key Deletion Practices**: It's a good practice to delete keys once their lifecycle ends or when theyâ€™re no longer in use. This helps reduce potential security vulnerabilities.

3. **Immediate Key Deletion**: For added security, consider deleting API keys immediately after use. This ensures that even if a key is intercepted, it cannot be exploited.

4. **Auth and Monitoring**: Always ensure that keys, especially in client-side applications, are accessed through a secure authentication mechanism. Logging API key creation and usage for each session can help track potential misuse.

## Technical Implementation

### Creating Short-Lived API Keys

To create short-lived API keys, you can use the Ephemeral Auth API. Here is a basic example using cURL:

```shell
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.deepgram.com/v1/ephemeral-keys \
     --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
       "comment": "Temporary key for session",
       "expires_in": 3600,
       "scopes": ["usage:read"]
     }'
```

### Secure Authentication Practices

- **Ephemeral Tokens**: Use ephemeral tokens for temporary access. This reduces the exposure of your main API keys.
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt traffic.
- **Server-Side Authentication**: Handle authentication server-side where possible, and send tokens to the client only when necessary.

## Conclusion

Effective management of short-lived API keys ensures both security and flexibility in deploying speech-to-text technology in client-side applications. Always monitor usage and enforce strict authentication to mitigate risks.

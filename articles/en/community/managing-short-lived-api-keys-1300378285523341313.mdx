<CommunityQuestion>I'm developing a web application that utilises the Deepgram speech-to-text API, but I'm concerned about security risks associated with exposing long-lived API keys in the client-side code. Is there a recommended approach to mitigate this issue?</CommunityQuestion>

When implementing in-browser speech-to-text using API keys, it is crucial to manage these keys effectively, particularly if they are short-lived. Unlike traditional long-term keys, short-lived keys offer enhanced security by limiting the time a key is valid, reducing the window of opportunity for misuse. However, this leads to challenges in managing the lifecycle of these keys.

## Key Considerations

1. **Unlimited Key Creation**: Rest assured, there are no caps on the number of API keys you can create in your Deepgram project. This means you can generate as many short-lived keys as needed without worrying about hitting a limit.

2. **Key Deletion Practices**: While there's no automatic policy to purge expired keys, it’s good practice to delete keys once their lifecycle ends or when they’re no longer in use. This can help keep your records clean and reduce potential security holes.

3. **Immediate Key Deletion**: For additional security, consider deleting API keys immediately after establishing a connection. This ensures that even if a key is intercepted after use, it cannot be exploited.

4. **Auth and Monitoring**: Always ensure that your keys, especially when used in client-side applications, are accessed only through a secure authentication mechanism. Recording which API key was created for each user session can help you track potential misuse. If suspicious activity is detected, you can trace back which key was used and take appropriate action.

## Conclusion
Effective management of short-lived API keys ensures both security and flexibility in deploying speech-to-text technology in client-side applications. Always monitor usage and enforce strict authentication to mitigate risks.

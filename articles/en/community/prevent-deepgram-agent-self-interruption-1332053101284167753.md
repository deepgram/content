# Prevent Deepgram Agent from Self-Interruption

### Understanding and Mitigating Deepgram Agent Self-Interruption

In certain scenarios, the Deepgram demo agent may seem to "talk to itself," where the system mistakenly interprets the agent's speech as user input. This behavior may be encountered when using the Deepgram agent without isolating audio sources effectively.

**Potential Causes and Solutions:**

To resolve this issue, consider employing one of the following strategies:

1. **Use a Headset:**
   - **Rationale:** Using a headset can help isolate the audio input from the microphone, preventing the system from capturing its own output as input.
   - **Implementation:** Ensure your computer settings are correctly configured to use the headset as both input and output devices.

2. **Programmatic Solutions:**
   - **Mute Microphone Input:** Implement logic in your application to temporarily mute the microphone while the agent is speaking. This ensures no input is captured during this period.
   - **Engage a Voice Activity Detector (VAD):** Utilize a VAD to control when the microphone sends audio data. By detecting user speech, you can manage when input should be transmitted to the agent, disengaging during the agent's speech.

#### Example: Using VAD to Control Audio Input

Integrate a local VAD within your application to efficiently manage audio input. The VAD can dynamically enable/disable the transmission of audio data based on user speech, reducing feedback loops where the agent hears its responses.

### Conclusion

By using a physical headset or programmable input controls like muting or VAD, you can optimize the interaction with the Deepgram agent and prevent it from self-interrupting. Testing different configurations based on your environment can determine the best solution for your application setup.

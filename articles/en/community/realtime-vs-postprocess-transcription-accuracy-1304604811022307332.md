# Real-time vs Post-processed Transcription Accuracy

When deciding between real-time transcription and post-processing a full audio file, understanding the differences in accuracy can help you choose the best solution for your needs.

## Accuracy Comparison

Deepgram's transcription services offer different levels of accuracy depending on the method used. 

1. **Pre-recorded Transcription**: This method typically offers higher accuracy because it leverages the entire audio context. Deepgram's benchmarks show a word error rate (WER) of 8.4% for pre-recorded English transcription. 

2. **Real-time Transcription**: In contrast, real-time transcription provides slightly less accuracy compared to pre-recorded because it processes audio as it comes in, without the advantage of overall context. The WER for real-time streaming is approximately 10.7%.

## When to Use Each Method

- **Use Pre-recorded Transcription** if accuracy is your paramount concern and you do not need the results to be instantaneous. Submitting the whole audio for post-process transcription will result in slightly more accurate results due to the availability of the full audio context.

- **Use Real-time Transcription** when you need immediate results, such as in scenarios where live feedback is vital. Although it trades off a bit of accuracy, the ability to get results in real-time can be critical for interactive applications.

## Code Examples

For those looking to implement either solution, Deepgram offers support across various SDKs.

### Python
```python
from deepgram import Deepgram
import asyncio

deepgram = Deepgram('YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY')

async def transcribe(audio_url):
    response = await deepgram.transcription.preamble(audio_url, {
        'punctuate': True
    })
    print(response)

asyncio.run(transcribe('audio_file_url'))
```

### Node.js / JavaScript
```javascript
const deepgram = new Deepgram('YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY');

(async () => {
    const response = await deepgram.transcription.preamble({
        'url': 'audio_file_url'
    }, {
        punctuate: true
    });
    console.log(response);
})();
```

### .NET
```csharp
using System;
using Deepgram;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient("YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY");
        var response = await deepgramClient.Transcriptions.PreambleAsync(
            new { url = "audio_file_url" },
            new TranscriptionOptions { Punctuate = true }
        );
        Console.WriteLine(response);
    }
}
```

### Rust
```rust
use deepgram::{Deepgram, AudioSource};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let deepgram = Deepgram::new("YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY");
    let transcript = deepgram.transcribe(AudioSource::url("audio_file_url")).await.unwrap();
    println!("{}", transcript);
}
```

### Go
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/deepgram"
)

func main() {
    client := deepgram.NewClient("YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY")
    response, err := client.TranscribeUrl("audio_file_url")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(response)
}
```

## Conclusion

If precision is crucial and time is flexible, opting for post-processed transcription will yield the best accuracy. However, real-time transcription is invaluable for immediate transcription needs, despite a slight trade-off in accuracy.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm working on a speech recognition project for Polish audio, but I'm noticing that the word 'ten' is often misinterpreted as the number 10. Any tips on how to handle this with Deepgram's API?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

In Polish speech-to-text (STT) services, the word 'ten' is often misinterpreted as the English number "10" due to phonetic similarity. This causes transcription inaccuracies, particularly in contexts where the word "ten" should be translated as "this" or another Polish term, rather than a numeric value.

### Understanding the Issue

In Polish, "ten" is a common word meaning "this". However, its phonetic resemblance to the English number "ten" can lead to incorrect transcriptions. This issue is exacerbated when numeric context is not present, causing confusion in the output.

### Improving Accuracy

To address this, consider the following strategies:

- **Post-Processing Scripts:** Implement scripts to identify and correct instances where "10" is used without surrounding numeric context. These scripts can adjust the transcription to "ten" based on linguistic cues.

  ```python
  import requests
  import json

  # Function to post-process Deepgram transcriptions
  def post_process_transcription(transcript):
      # Replace instances of "10" with "ten" when not in numeric context
      corrected_transcript = transcript.replace(" 10 ", " ten ")
      return corrected_transcript

  # Example transcription response from Deepgram
  response = {
      "results": {
          "channels": [{
              "alternatives": [{
                  "transcript": "To jest 10 powodów."
              }]
          }]
      }
  }

  # Extract the transcript
  transcript = response["results"]["channels"][0]["alternatives"][0]["transcript"]

  # Post-process the transcript
  corrected_transcript = post_process_transcription(transcript)
  print(corrected_transcript)  # Output: "To jest ten powodów."
  ```

- **Custom Models and Training:** Provide specific training data to improve the recognition of context-specific words like "ten". Engage with Deepgram's model customisation options for enhanced performance with Polish language nuances.

- **Keyword Boosting:** Use Deepgram's keyword boosting feature to prioritise the transcription of "ten" over "10" when relevant. This requires using the Nova 3 model and keyterm prompting.

### Conclusion

While automatic speech recognition systems are continually improving, linguistic nuances such as homophones pose challenges. By implementing post-processing solutions, exploring model customisation, or using keyword boosting, you can enhance transcription accuracy for words like "ten".

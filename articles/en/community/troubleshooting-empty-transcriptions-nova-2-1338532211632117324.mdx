<CommunityQuestion>I'm using Deepgram's Nova speech-to-text models, but I often get empty transcriptions when streaming audio. What could be causing this issue, and how can I troubleshoot it?</CommunityQuestion>

When using Deepgram's speech-to-text API, you might occasionally encounter situations where transcriptions return empty results or the confidence drops to zero. This article provides guidance on troubleshooting these issues, particularly when using Nova models.

## Common Scenarios That Can Cause Empty Transcriptions

1. **Sparse or Intermittent Audio Input**: When sending small, sporadic audio chunks with long pauses, models may struggle to maintain context.
2. **Low Audio Quality**: Very quiet or noisy audio can lead to poor transcription results.
3. **Connection Issues**: Network problems or WebSocket disconnections.
4. **Extended Silence**: Long periods of silence can cause the model to reset its context.
5. **Inappropriate Model Configuration**: Using incorrect parameters for your audio type.

## Specific Solutions Based on Use Case

### For Live Streaming with Intermittent Audio

If you're experiencing empty transcriptions after a period of successful transcription (often around 8 minutes):

1. **Use Nova 3 for Improved Performance**:
   - The Nova 3 model is more robust with varying audio input patterns:
   ```json
   {
     "model": "nova-3",
     "smart_format": true
   }
   ```

2. **Send KeepAlive Messages During Silences**:
   - Maintain the WebSocket connection during long silent periods:
   ```json
   { "type": "KeepAlive" }
   ```

3. **Configure Appropriate Endpointing**:
   - For sporadic speech, adjust the endpointing parameter to accommodate longer pauses:
   ```
   endpointing=1000
   ```

### For Pre-recorded Audio with Quality Issues

If you're getting empty transcriptions with pre-recorded files:

1. **Check Audio Volume and Quality**:
   - Ensure the audio isn't extremely quiet.
   - Normalize audio levels if necessary.
   - Remove excessive background noise if possible.

2. **Verify Audio Format Compatibility**:
   - Ensure your audio format is supported by Deepgram.
   - Specify correct encoding and sample rate parameters.
   - See [Determining Your Audio Format](/docs/determining-your-audio-format-for-live-streaming-audio).

3. **Try Different Nova Model Variants**:
   - For specific domains (e.g., meetings, phone calls), use the appropriate model variant:
   ```
   model=nova-3-meeting
   ```
   or
   ```
   model=nova-3-phonecall
   ```

## Code Implementation for Live Streaming Sparse Audio

Here's a JavaScript example that handles intermittent audio input:

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');

// Configure the WebSocket connection with Nova 3 for sparse audio
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3&smart_format=true&encoding=linear16&sample_rate=16000', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY'
  }
});

// Keep track of silence for keepalive
let lastAudioSentTime = Date.now();
let keepAliveInterval;

// Start sending audio and set up keepalive for silences
function startStreaming() {
  // Start audio capture logic...
  
  // Set up keepalive during silence periods
  keepAliveInterval = setInterval(() => {
    const silenceDuration = Date.now() - lastAudioSentTime;
    if (silenceDuration > 5000) {  // 5 seconds of silence
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'KeepAlive' }));
    }
  }, 5000);
}

// Send audio data with checks
function sendAudioChunk(audioData) {
  if (audioData && audioData.length > 0) {
    ws.send(audioData);
    lastAudioSentTime = Date.now();
  }
}

// Handle transcription results
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const result = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (result.type === 'Results') {
    // Process transcription result
  }
};

// Error handling
ws.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
};

ws.onclose = () => {
  clearInterval(keepAliveInterval);
  console.log('WebSocket connection closed');
};
```

## SDK Update Recommendation

Ensure you're using the latest version of Deepgram's SDKs:

- [JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk)
- [Go SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk)
- [Dotnet SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk)
- [Rust SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-rust-sdk)

Updated SDKs often contain fixes for issues related to empty transcriptions and connection handling.

# Deepgram Diarization Pricing Information

The Deepgram API offers powerful speech-to-text capabilities, including features like speaker diarization which distinguishes between different speakers in an audio recording. Some users often wonder if enabling such features incurs additional costs. It's important to note that features like speaker diarization are included in the cost of transcription itself and do not require extra charges.

## Understanding Deepgram Pricing
Deepgram operates on a usage-based pricing model, where costs are determined by the total requests and usage of Deepgram services in the form of "Credits." The pricing structure includes various features such as Speaker Diarization, Smart Formatting, Automatic Language Detection, among others, without charging additional fees for activating these features.

## When to Use Speaker Diarization
Whether or not to use speaker diarization is largely dependent on your specific use case. While speaker diarization is incredibly useful for scenarios with multiple speakers, enabling it when unnecessary does not provide any cost savings, given that the charges are related to usage volumes.

For a comprehensive understanding of the cost implications when using Deepgram's features, it's advisable to visit the Deepgram [pricing page](https://deepgram.com/pricing) for detailed information about their usage-based pricing model.

## Conclusion
The decision to enable features like speaker diarization should be informed by its relevance to your specific use case. While there is no additional cost for enabling these features, they contribute to the overall usage metrics which inform the pricing model.

<CommunityQuestion>I've been having trouble getting real-time transcription to work with Deepgram's WebSocket API. The audio seems to be sent correctly, but I'm not getting any transcription responses. What could be going wrong?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

When setting up real-time transcription with Deepgram's WebSocket API, users may encounter issues such as missing transcription responses, connection errors, or misconfigured WebSocket parameters. Common error codes include `1008` - `DATA-0000` and `1011` - `NET-0001`, indicating problems with audio data and connection timeouts, respectively.

### Using Websockets

Establishing a WebSocket connection for transcribing audio in real-time with Deepgram involves sending audio data in appropriate chunks and handling server responses accurately. Missteps during this process can result in failed transcription retrieval.

### Common Challenges and Solutions

1. **Audio Chunk Size**

   If audio is sent in exceedingly small chunks, such as under 0.03 seconds each, this might not trigger a sufficient processing response from the Deepgram server. Ensure that audio data chunks are of a reasonable size, preferably around a few hundred milliseconds, to be processed efficiently.

2. **Handling WebSocket Responses**

   It’s important to handle WebSocket responses correctly. If you are waiting for a response from the server before sending additional audio chunks, make sure the implementation doesn’t inadvertently halt the transmission of further audio data until a response is received. This can lead to only part of the audio being sent to the server, preventing successful transcription.

3. **Configuration Validation**

   Double-check the WebSocket connection parameters, ensuring they match Deepgram's requirements. This includes verifying the correct WebSocket endpoint, authentication, and any query parameters necessary for your transcription configuration. Refer to the [Deepgram WebSocket API Documentation](/reference#websockets) for detailed configuration guidance.

4. **Troubleshooting WebSocket Errors**

   - **Error Code `1008` - `DATA-0000`**: This indicates that Deepgram can't decode the audio data. Ensure the audio data is correctly encoded and the encoding parameters are explicitly set.
   - **Error Code `1011` - `NET-0001`**: This occurs when Deepgram does not receive enough audio data within the first 10 seconds. Make sure to send audio data promptly after establishing the connection and consider sending a [KeepAlive message](/reference/streaming#stream-keepalive) to maintain the connection.

### Conclusion

Successfully configuring and troubleshooting a Deepgram WebSocket transcription setup involves ensuring proper audio chunking and response handling. Assure that the WebSocket flow is smooth and check for any blocking operations that await responses unnecessarily.

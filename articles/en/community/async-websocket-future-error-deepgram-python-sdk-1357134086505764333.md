# Resolving Async WebSocket Future Error in Deepgram Python SDK

When working with the Deepgram Python SDK for live speech-to-text functionalities via WebSocket connections, you might encounter an error related to asynchronous handling. Specifically, you may see an error message indicating that a task encountered a pending future attached to a different event loop. This suggests issues with asyncio execution in your implementation.

## Understanding the Error

The error message:

```
[2025-03-25 09:25:49,552] ERROR - send() failed - Exception: Task <Task pending ...> got Future <Future pending> attached to a different loop
```

indicates that there is a conflict between futures and event loops. This is common when dealing with asynchronous code where a future created in one event loop is attempted to be run in another.

## Steps to Resolve

1. **Ensure Consistent Event Loops**:
   - The fundamental issue is likely due to attempting to run futures in a different loop than intended. Ensure that all asynchronous tasks and futures are run within the same event loop context.

2. **Use the Intended SDK Functions**:
   - Consider using the Deepgram Python SDK's built-in functionalities for handling WebSocket connections. This SDK abstracts much of the complexity and ensures proper setup of event loops.
   - Explore the [Deepgram Python SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk) for examples.

3. **Check SDK Examples**:
   - Review working examples in the [Deepgram Python SDK examples section](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main/examples/speech-to-text/websocket). These examples demonstrate correct usage patterns and can be used as a reference.

4. **Integration with AsyncIO**:
   - Ensure that your application is using the `asyncio` library consistently and correctly. Use `asyncio.run()` to run the main entry point of your program to ensure all async functions are executed on the correct event loop.

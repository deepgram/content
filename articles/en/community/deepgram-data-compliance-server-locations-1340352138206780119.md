# Deepgram's Data Compliance and Server Locations

Deepgram is committed to ensuring data security and compliance with regulations, which is critical for users considering its Speech to Text API, especially within the context of EEA regulations.

## Deepgram's Compliance

Deepgram is both GDPR and SOC Type 2 compliant. These compliance measures ensure that data protection and privacy standards are upheld, making Deepgram a trustworthy choice for handling sensitive information.

GDPR compliance specifically addresses the protection of personal data and privacy in the European Economic Area (EEA), while SOC Type 2 compliance demonstrates adherence to stringent security and privacy controls.

## Server Locations

As of now, Deepgram's servers are located in the United States. While this may impact decisions for businesses specifically requiring data residency within the EEA, Deepgram's compliance with GDPR provides significant safeguards for data protection.

For users concerned about data residency, it's crucial to evaluate how data is processed and stored to ensure it aligns with organizational policies and regional regulations.

## Conclusion

While currently all servers are based in the United States, Deepgram's commitment to GDPR and SOC Type 2 compliance offers strong data protection measures. If data residency within the EEA is a critical requirement, evaluating the potential impact and considering compliance mitigation strategies is advised.

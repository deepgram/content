<CommunityQuestion>I'm developing a real-time transcription application using Deepgram's WebSocket API, but I'm struggling to understand when to use the 'Finalize' message versus closing the stream entirely. Could you explain the difference and provide guidance on optimising the transcription process?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

Developers often face challenges in deciding when to use the `Finalize` message versus the `Close Stream` message while working with Deepgram's WebSocket API for real-time transcription. Understanding the right use case for each can be crucial for ensuring efficient audio stream management, minimising latency, and maximising transcription accuracy. This article provides insights into optimising these processes.

### Real-Time Processing

Real-time transcription involves sending audio to the WebSocket API, which returns text transcriptions as audio is streamed. The transcription process is optimised to ensure low latency in text delivery, providing users with near-instantaneous feedback as they speak.

### Finalization vs. Close Stream

When dealing with real-time streaming, understanding the distinction between the `Finalize` and `Close Stream` messages in the WebSocket API is essential:

- **Finalize Message**: This is used for mid-stream finalisation. It's particularly useful if you have your own client-side Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and want to signal the server to process buffered data without closing the connection entirely. However, it doesn’t always guarantee a final response if there isn’t a significant buffer of audio.

  ```javascript
  const finalizeMsg = JSON.stringify({ type: "Finalize" });
  ws.send(finalizeMsg);
  ```

- **Close Stream Message**: When you send a `Close Stream` message, the API processes any remaining buffered audio, returns final transcription results, and gracefully closes the WebSocket connection. This method ensures that all audio data is accounted for, and the final text is reliably transmitted back to the client.

  ```javascript
  const closeStreamMsg = JSON.stringify({ type: "CloseStream" });
  ws.send(closeStreamMsg);
  ws.close();
  ```

Consider the following scenario when choosing the appropriate message type:

- **Short Utterances**: If streaming short audio clips (e.g., single words or brief phrases), it's advisable to use `Close Stream` once the audio input is finished, ensuring a complete final response.

- **Continuous Stream**: In a scenario where real-time continuous speech is expected, utilise `Finalize` for managing partial results if necessary, but conclude with `Close Stream` to finalise your session.

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for WebSocket connections to manage unexpected disconnects or network issues efficiently.

```javascript
ws.on('error', function error(err) {
  console.error('WebSocket error:', err.message);
});
```

```javascript
ws.on('close', function close() {
  console.log('WebSocket connection closed.');
});
```

### Best Practices

To optimise your real-time transcription using Deepgram, here are some best practices:

1. **Connection Management**: Maintain WebSocket connections only as long as necessary to manage network resources efficiently and reduce overhead.
2. **Network Latency**: Ensure stable and fast network connectivity to minimise transmission delay between client and server.
3. **Final Transcription**: Always use `Close Stream` at the end of the session to ensure all buffered audio is processed and the final transcript is received.

### Conclusion

By discerning the use of `Finalize` vs. `Close Stream` in the Deepgram API, developers can ensure that their systems reliably return full and accurate transcriptions with minimal processing delay. This optimisation is particularly beneficial in applications where speed and accuracy are paramount.

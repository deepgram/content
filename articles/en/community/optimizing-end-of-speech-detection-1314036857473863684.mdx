<CommunityQuestion>I'm working on a project that involves transcribing phone calls with a lot of background noise. The standard settings on Deepgram's API aren't handling the noisy audio very well. Could anyone offer some tips on optimising the end of speech detection for these kinds of challenging environments?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

Detecting the end of speech in audio with substantial background noise can be challenging. This is particularly true in scenarios involving phone calls, where background noise might interfere with the accuracy of speech recognition. This article provides strategies to enhance end of speech detection using Deepgram's API by optimising configurations and selecting the appropriate models.

### Configuring Deepgram API for Noisy Environments

When working with audio that contains background noise, fine-tuning parameters such as `endpointing` and `utterance_end_ms` within the Deepgram API can significantly improve detection accuracy:

- **`endpointing` Parameter**: Controls the sensitivity of end of speech detection. Lower values increase sensitivity by detecting shorter pauses. Adjust this to prevent missing speech endings in noisy environments.
  
- **`utterance_end_ms` Parameter**: Determines the duration the system waits before considering speech ended. Increasing this value helps avoid interpreting pauses as speech end in intermittent noise scenarios.

```json
{
  "encoding": "mulaw",
  "sample_rate": "8000",
  "model": "nova-3-phonecall",
  "smart_format": true,
  "interim_results": true,
  "endpointing": 150,
  "utterance_end_ms": 1200
}
```

**Error Handling Example**:
Ensure to incorporate error handling in production environments:

```python
import requests

def transcribe_audio(audio_url, api_key):
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen',
            headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'},
            json={
                "url": audio_url,
                "encoding": "mulaw",
                "sample_rate": 8000,
                "model": "nova-3-phonecall",
                "smart_format": True,
                "interim_results": True,
                "endpointing": 150,
                "utterance_end_ms": 1200
            }
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Replace 'YOUR_AUDIO_URL' and 'YOUR_API_KEY' with actual values
transcription_result = transcribe_audio('YOUR_AUDIO_URL', 'YOUR_API_KEY')
```

### Selecting the Right Model

Choosing the correct model can enhance performance under specific conditions. For phone call audio, the `nova-3-phonecall` model is optimised for this context, improving accuracy in noisy environments.

For more information on models, see [Deepgram Models & Languages Overview](/docs/models-languages-overview#nova-3).

### Conclusion

Adjusting parameters such as `endpointing` and `utterance_end_ms`, along with selecting the appropriate model, can significantly improve the accuracy of speech detection in noisy environments. Regular testing with real-world data is essential to fine-tune these settings effectively.

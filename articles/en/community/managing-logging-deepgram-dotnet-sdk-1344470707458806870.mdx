<CommunityQuestion>How might one go about disabling or redirecting the log files generated by Deepgram's .NET SDK? I have a deployment where these logs are not needed, and I'd like to clean up the output.</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

When using the Deepgram .NET SDK in your project, you might encounter a situation where log files are automatically generated in your program's folder. These files typically contain SDK configuration and connection logs, which may not always be relevant for every application deployment.

## Solution

To manage the logging behaviour in the Deepgram .NET SDK, you can configure or disable logging through the SDK's settings. This can be achieved by modifying the SDK's configuration files or source code to redirect or suppress unnecessary log outputs.

### Configure Logging

The Deepgram .NET SDK provides options to adjust logging settings through configuration files or environment variables. Here's how you can manage logging configurations:

```csharp
using Deepgram;
using Deepgram.Models;

public class LoggingConfiguration
{
    public static void ConfigureLogging()
    {
        var deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient("YOUR_API_KEY");

        // Example: Adjust logging settings here
        // This code assumes modifications to the logger configuration
        // For detailed options, refer to the official SDK documentation

        // Example of handling potential errors
        try
        {
            // Code to modify logging configurations
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error configuring logging: " + ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Considerations

- **Configuration Management**: It's often preferable to manage logging through configuration files or environment variables rather than code changes. This allows for easier adjustments across different environments.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure that error handling is in place when modifying logging configurations to catch and address any issues that may arise.

# Optimizing TTS for Accurate Acronym Pronunciation

In text-to-speech (TTS) applications, accurately pronouncing acronyms can be challenging. This guide provides insights into managing acronym pronunciation effectively using Deepgram's TTS API.

## Understanding Acronym Pronunciation

Acronyms, such as "ABC" or "USP," can sometimes be articulated as words (e.g., "abse" instead of "A-B-C") by TTS systems. This often occurs due to the system interpreting the letters as a unit rather than individual characters. 

### Tips for Managing Acronym Pronunciation

To enhance the accuracy of acronym pronunciation, consider the following strategies:

1. **Phonetic Input:** Manually spell out the acronym with spaces or hyphens to suggest a character-by-character reading, for example, "A B C" instead of "ABC."

2. **Customized Pronunciation:** Utilize TTS prompting techniques to adjust pronunciation settings. For detailed methods, explore Deepgram's [TTS Prompting Guide](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/text-to-speech-prompting).

3. **Testing and Iteration:** Regularly test how acronyms are pronounced in your specific application context and iterate over the inputs or settings to reach the desired output.

## Conclusion

Enhancing acronym pronunciation is vital for ensuring clarity and accuracy in TTS applications. By employing strategies such as phonetic spelling and customizing API settings, you can significantly improve how acronyms are articulated.

# Improving Accuracy of Spelled Words in Transcriptions

To enhance the accuracy of transcriptions when words are spelled out, such as "J-A-Y" being interpreted correctly instead of phonetically, several strategies can be applied using Deepgram's APIs and settings. These methods are particularly useful in scenarios where phonetic representations might disrupt the intended transcription.

### Strategies for Accurate Spelling Transcription

#### 1. Use Keywords to Boost Accuracy
Deepgram allows for the use of keywords to improve the accuracy of certain expected words in the transcription process. By applying this feature, you can significantly enhance the recognition of spelled or commonly misinterpreted words.

#### 2. Implement Find and Replace
For scenarios where certain words or phrases are consistently misrecognized, Deepgram provides a find and replace feature. This can be utilized to automatically correct these phrases post-transcription.

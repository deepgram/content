<CommunityQuestion>I've been using Deepgram's speech-to-text API, but the transcriptions are lacking punctuation, which makes them difficult to read. Additionally, I'm finding that the audio input speed is affecting the accuracy of the transcriptions. Are there any techniques I can use to enhance the transcription experience for my users?</CommunityQuestion>

To deliver the best transcription services, it's essential to address two common issues that may arise: the absence of punctuation in transcriptions and optimizing audio input speed for automatic speech recognition. To help you improve the user experience, let's explore some techniques to handle these scenarios effectively.

## Enabling Punctuation in Transcription

Deepgram's Dictation feature can transform spoken dictation commands into punctuation marks, enhancing the readability of transcriptions. To leverage this feature:

- Enable the `dictation` parameter by setting it to `true` in your API request.
- Ensure the `punctuate` parameter is also enabled for dictation to operate correctly.

For example, to use these parameters in an API request, you could:

```bash
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?dictation=true&punctuate=true'
```

### Error Handling

When implementing the API request, it's crucial to include error handling to manage potential issues such as network errors or invalid API keys. Here's an enhanced example with error handling using Python:

```python
import requests

def transcribe_audio(file_path):
    url = "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?dictation=true&punctuate=true"
    headers = {
        'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'audio/wav'
    }
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
        try:
            response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=audio_file)
            response.raise_for_status()
            print("Transcription:", response.json())
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

transcribe_audio('youraudio.wav')
```

## Managing Audio Input Speed

Addressing the speed at which audio is processed is crucial for accurate recognition. If your transcriptions are coming through too quickly, consider:

1. **Verifying Audio Input Rate:** Ensure that your audio input rate matches Deepgram's requirements. Deepgram supports a range of sample rates, but optimising for common rates like 16kHz is recommended.
   
2. **Resampling Audio:** Use audio processing tools to resample your audio files to a suitable rate if necessary. Here's an example using Python with the `pydub` library:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

def resample_audio(input_file, output_file, target_sample_rate=16000):
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(input_file)
    audio = audio.set_frame_rate(target_sample_rate)
    audio.export(output_file, format="wav")

resample_audio('original_audio.wav', 'resampled_audio.wav')
```

By ensuring the appropriate rate, you can enhance the recognition performance, making the transcription service more reliable and efficient.

## Implementation and Support

If you're not familiar with the technical aspects, collaborating with developers is an excellent approach to implementing these solutions effectively. However, if you need further assistance, don't hesitate to join discussions on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions). Our community and support channels are always available to help.

### Conclusion

By enabling features such as `dictation` and `punctuate`, and ensuring a manageable audio input rate, you can significantly improve the transcription quality. Experimenting and collaborating with tech partners will further refine the process, ensuring a premium user experience.

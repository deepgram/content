<CommunityQuestion>I'm working on a medical transcription project and require high accuracy for complex terminology. How can I access Deepgram's specialised medical model for this purpose?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

When dealing with medical transcription, achieving high accuracy is crucial due to the complex and technical nature of medical terminology. Deepgram's Nova-3 Medical model is specifically optimised for this purpose, providing enhanced transcription accuracy for medical audio content.

## Overview of the Nova-3 Medical Model

Deepgram's Nova-3 Medical model is designed to accurately transcribe medical audio content. It leverages advanced speech-to-text algorithms optimised for medical terminology, enabling precise transcription of complex medical language and jargon.

## Using the Nova-3 Medical Model in Your Request

To utilise the Nova-3 Medical model, include the model option `nova-3-medical` in your transcription request. This ensures that Deepgram processes the audio using the model specifically trained for medical audio content, enhancing transcription quality for medical recordings.

### Example Request

When making a request to the Deepgram API, specify the model in your request parameters. Here is an example using Python with error handling:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "audio/wav"
}

try:
    with open('youraudio.wav', 'rb') as audio:
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, params={"model": "nova-3-medical"}, data=audio)
    response.raise_for_status()
    print(response.json())
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Ensure that your requests to the Deepgram API endpoint use the correct API key and adhere to the required formatting for parameters. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Deepgram API key.

## Alternative Solutions

If you encounter issues accessing the Nova-3 Medical model, consider using other Deepgram models that may suit your needs, or contact [Deepgram support](https://deepgram.com/contact/) for assistance.

# Managing Credits for Deepgram Transcription Services

In some instances, users may encounter unexpected changes in their Deepgram account credits, such as a sudden decrease in promotional credits or discrepancies in billing. Understanding how to manage and track your credit usage and knowing the available support options can help mitigate any confusion or issues.

### Understanding Promotional and Purchased Credits

Credits on Deepgram accounts may include both promotional and purchased credits. Promotional credits are often provided for trial purposes or special offers, while purchased credits are those you buy for using Deepgram's services. Both types of credits contribute to your available balance and are utilized as you make transcription requests.

#### Promotional Credits

Promotional credits usually come with an expiration date (traditionally, these expire one year after issuance) and are removed automatically from your account once they expire. It's essential to track the expiration date of these credits, which you can typically view on your billing page.

### Tracking Credit Usage

To get insights into your usage and credit consumption, Deepgram provides a dashboard where you can monitor your projectâ€™s usage information. This can be helpful for identifying patterns in API requests, such as unexpected spikes or consistent trends that might contribute to a sudden depletion of credits.

#### Billing Page Access

Visit your billing page in the Deepgram console to see a detailed breakdown of your credits and their types (if available). This includes any remaining promotional credits and purchased credits before they expire or are consumed.

### Resolving Credit Issues

If you discover an unexpected depletion of credits, it could potentially be due to expired promotional credits or connectivity issues during transcription requests. 

- **Contact for Support:** If you believe there's an inconsistency in your credit usage, reach out for help by visiting the Deepgram community at [Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram) or via the contact options available in your account.
- **Reinstating Promotional Credits:** In response to requests, credits lost overnight due to errors or connectivity issues can sometimes be reinstated as an administrative fix.

### Best Practices

- **Monitor Usage Regularly:** Periodically check your usage statistics via the Deepgram console to ensure your credits are being utilized as anticipated.
- **Understand Expiry Date:** Keep track of promotional credit expiration and manage requests accordingly.

If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: https://discord.gg/deepgram

### Conclusion

Understanding how credits are managed within Deepgram's services allows you to better handle unexpected deductions and collaboratively resolve them with support. Keeping an eye on your billing and usage pages provides transparency and helps maintain control over your transcription expenditures.

<CommunityQuestion>I've been encountering 503 and 504 errors quite frequently when using the Deepgram API for transcription. What could be causing these errors and how can I avoid them?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

503 and 504 errors can disrupt your interactions with Deepgram APIs, affecting transcription services and other operations. Understanding these errors and implementing strategies to mitigate them can enhance the reliability of your applications.

## What are 503 and 504 Errors?

- **503 Service Unavailable**: This error indicates that the server cannot currently handle the request, often due to overload or maintenance.
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: This error occurs when the server does not receive a timely response from an upstream server.

### Example Error Messages

```json
{
  "error_code": "Service Unavailable",
  "err_msg": "Please try again later.",
  "request_id": "unique_request_id"
}
```

```json
{
  "error_code": "Gateway Timeout",
  "err_msg": "The server did not receive a timely response.",
  "request_id": "unique_request_id"
}
```

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Monitoring**: Regularly check Deepgram's [status page](https://status.deepgram.com) for updates on outages or maintenance.
- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic in your application to gracefully handle temporary outages. Here's an improved example in Python:

    ```python
    import requests
    import time

    def transcribe_with_retry(api_url, headers, max_retries=3):
        retries = 0
        while retries < max_retries:
            try:
                response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    return response.json()
                elif response.status_code in [503, 504]:
                    retries += 1
                    time.sleep(2 ** retries)  # Exponential backoff
                else:
                    print(f"Unexpected status code: {response.status_code}")
                    break
            except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
                print(f"Request failed: {e}")
                retries += 1
        return None

    # Usage
    api_url = "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speech"
    headers = {"Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"}
    result = transcribe_with_retry(api_url, headers)
    ```

    > **Note**: Ensure you replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key securely, avoiding hardcoding in production environments.

- **Network and Server Configuration**: Validate your network connectivity and server settings to rule out local causes of 503 and 504 errors. Use tools like `ping` and `traceroute` to diagnose network issues.
- **Contact Support**: If issues persist, reach out to [Deepgram Support](/docs/support) or visit community forums like [Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions).

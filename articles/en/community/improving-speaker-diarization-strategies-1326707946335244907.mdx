<CommunityQuestion>I've been utilising Deepgram's speech-to-text API for transcription, but I'm facing challenges with accurately distinguishing between multiple speakers in my audio files. Are there any practical strategies I could employ to enhance speaker diarization, particularly when working with non-English languages?</CommunityQuestion>

Deepgram offers diarization capabilities designed to differentiate between speakers in audio files. While this feature is powerful, users may encounter challenges, especially with non-English languages in certain models like nova-phonecall and nova-medical. Below are strategies to enhance diarization results:

**Diarization Challenges:**
  
- **Inconsistent Speaker Detection with Nova-2:**
  The diarization feature can sometimes be unreliable when using the nova-2 model, leading to low accuracy in distinguishing speakers.
  
- **Language Limitations:**
  Models such as nova-phonecall and nova-medical may return errors when attempting diarization with languages other than English, due to the current limitations of supported languages.

**Strategies to Improve Diarization:**

1. **Prepend Audio from the Primary Speaker:**
   For audio files under 3 minutes, prepend a 30-second clip of the primary speaker's voice to assist the diarization model in identifying the speaker more accurately. [Help Center Documentation](https://deepgram.gitbook.io/help-center/faq/improving-diarization-by-prepending-audio-from-the-primary-speaker)

2. **Utilize Multichannel Audio:**
   Whenever possible, use multichannel audio, where each speaker is on a separate channel, to enhance the diarization accuracy. [Deepgram Docs](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/diarization)

3. **Combine Multichannel with Diarization:**
   For improved results, accompany multichannel audio with diarization capabilities. This approach can assist in situations where diarization alone may struggle. [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions/939)

4. **Use Longer Audio Files:**
   Diarization performance generally benefits from longer audio samples, so provide extended audio recordings when feasible.

5. **Ensure High Audio Quality:**
   The quality of audio significantly impacts diarization. Make efforts to maintain high-quality audio by avoiding degraded signals, such as those resulting from recording through computer speakers. [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions/283)

**Conclusion**

By implementing these strategies, users can maximize the reliability and accuracy of Deepgram's diarization features.

<CommunityQuestion>I've been utilising Deepgram's speech-to-text API for transcription, but I'm facing challenges with accurately distinguishing between multiple speakers in my audio files. Are there any practical strategies I could employ to enhance speaker diarization, particularly when working with non-English languages?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

Improving the accuracy of speaker diarization can be challenging, especially when dealing with non-English languages or low-quality audio recordings. Users may encounter difficulties in distinguishing between speakers due to model limitations or audio quality issues.

## Strategies to Improve Diarization

Deepgram offers robust diarization capabilities, particularly with the latest Nova 3 model. Here are strategies to enhance your diarization results:

1. **Utilise the Latest Model: Nova 3**
   Always use the latest model, Nova 3, for improved accuracy in speaker diarization. This model provides enhanced support for multiple languages and better speaker detection.

2. **Prepend Audio from the Primary Speaker**
   For short audio files (under 3 minutes), prepend a 30-second clip of the primary speaker's voice to help the model identify speakers more accurately.

3. **Use Multichannel Audio**
   If possible, record each speaker on a separate audio channel. This approach can significantly improve diarization accuracy. Enable the `multichannel` parameter in your API request:

   ```shell
   curl \
     --request POST \
     --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?multichannel=true&diarize=true' \
     --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY' \
     --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
     --data-binary @your-audio-file.wav
   ```

   Ensure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Deepgram API key.

4. **Combine Multichannel with Diarization**
   For best results, combine multichannel audio with diarization capabilities. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex audio scenarios involving multiple speakers.

5. **Provide Longer Audio Samples**
   Longer audio samples generally yield better diarization results as the model has more context to differentiate speakers.

6. **Ensure High Audio Quality**
   High-quality audio is crucial for effective diarization. Avoid degraded signals by ensuring the use of good recording equipment and environments.

## Conclusion

By adopting these strategies, you can enhance the reliability and accuracy of Deepgram's speaker diarization features. For further assistance, connect with the Deepgram community or support team.

<CommunityQuestion>I'm getting a 'tasks cancelled error' when using Deepgram's live speech-to-text API for longer audio files. How can I resolve this frustrating issue?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

The "tasks cancelled error" occurs when using Deepgram's live Speech-to-Text (STT) API, typically due to an unexpected WebSocket connection closure or timeout. This error can disrupt the transcription process for longer audio files, leading to incomplete or missing transcriptions. Understanding its causes and implementing effective solutions can help maintain a seamless transcription experience.

## Common Causes

1. **Connection Timeouts**: A short timeout setting might prematurely terminate the connection, especially with lengthy audio files.
2. **Corrupt or Unsupported Audio**: The WebSocket connection will fail if Deepgram detects unsupported or corrupt audio data.
3. **Network Issues**: Disruptions in network connectivity can lead to an abrupt closure of the connection.

## Solutions

1. **Increase Timeout Settings**: Adjust the timeout settings if you are using a specific Deepgram SDK. This can help accommodate longer audio durations. Refer to the [Deepgram SDK documentation](/docs/deepgram-sdks) for guidance on modifying these settings.

2. **Send a Finalise Message**: Ensure all messages are processed by sending a finalise message over the WebSocket:
   ```json
   { "type": "Finalise" }
   ```
   This is useful to flush pending messages before closing the connection.

3. **Validate Audio Formats**: Ensure your audio data complies with Deepgram's format specifications. Tools like [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) can assist in converting audio formats if necessary. See [Determining Your Audio Format](/docs/determining-your-audio-format-for-live-streaming-audio) for more details.

4. **Adjust Endpointing and Utterance Settings**: Configure settings to prevent transcription from cutting off prematurely. Adjust parameters like:
   ```python
   options = {
       "endpointing": 500,  # Adjust to suitable value
       "utterance_end_ms": 1000,
       "vad_events": True
   }
   ```
   Modifying these parameters can help prevent premature connection closures. Refer to [Streaming API Reference](/reference/streaming) for more information.

5. **Implement Error Handling**: Incorporate error handling in your code to manage interruptions effectively. For example:
   ```python
   try:
       # Your streaming transcription logic here
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
       # Additional error handling logic
   ```

## Conclusion

Addressing the "tasks cancelled error" involves tuning your connection settings, audio data formatting, and network reliability. Monitoring these aspects should minimise occurrences of this error. If issues persist or the system behaviour seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Discord Community](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

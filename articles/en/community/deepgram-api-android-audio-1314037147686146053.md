# Using Deepgram API for Android Audio Transcription

Deepgram provides flexible and robust APIs that can be used for audio transcription tasks across multiple platforms, including Android. While Deepgram's SDKs are available for programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, Go, .NET, and Rust, using the REST API directly allows you to implement transcription functionality without needing a dedicated SDK for Java or Kotlin.

## Getting Started with Audio Transcription on Android

To transcribe streaming audio input from an Android device's microphone, you can utilize Deepgram’s Live Transcription API. The API operates via a WebSocket connection and supports integration in Java-based languages for Android applications.

### Steps to Transcribe Audio Using the Deepgram API:

1. **Gather Required Libraries:** You'll need to use libraries that support WebSockets in Java or Kotlin. Popular libraries include [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/).

2. **Set Up WebSocket Connection:** Establish a WebSocket connection to Deepgram’s Live Transcription endpoint, `wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen`, and provide your authentication token.

3. **Capture Audio:** Use Android's audio capture functionality to get audio data from the microphone. Process this audio data so it can be streamed in real-time to the WebSocket connection.

4. **Send Audio for Transcription:** Stream the captured audio to the API endpoint through the WebSocket. The API will process the audio in real-time and provide transcriptions.

5. **Handle Transcription Responses:** Implement handlers to receive transcription results from the WebSocket, which can then be displayed or processed in your application as needed.

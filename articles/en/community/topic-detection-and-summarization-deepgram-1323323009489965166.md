# Integrating Topic Detection and Summarization with Deepgram

Deepgram provides powerful API features like topic detection and summarization for speech-to-text tasks. While these capabilities operate separately, you can create custom implementations to achieve integrated behavior, such as generating summaries for detected topics in your transcriptions.

### Topic Detection and Summarization Workflow

To get started, you can use JavaScript and the Deepgram SDK to accomplish this task. Begin by detecting topics in the transcribed text, and then generate summaries to create concise overviews for each topic.

Here's a conceptual approach for integrating topic detection and summarization:

1. **Transcribe Audio:** First, use Deepgram's transcription API to convert your audio data into text.

2. **Detect Topics:** Process the transcribed text to detect various topics using Deepgram's capabilities. This allows you to isolate segments of text that pertain to specific topics.

3. **Generate Summaries:** For each detected topic, summarize the content to provide a high-level overview of the subject matter without retaining the entire text.

Consider this pseudo-code in JavaScript for integration:

```javascript
async function detectAndSummarize(audioUrl) {
    // Step 1: Transcribe audio
    const transcription = await transcribeAudio(audioUrl);

    // Assume transcribeAudio is a function that calls Deepgram API for transcription

    // Step 2: Detect topics
    const topics = await detectTopics(transcription);

    // Step 3: Summarize each topic
    const summaries = topics.map(async (topic) => {
        const summary = await summarizeTopic(topic);
        return summary;
    });

    return summaries;
}
```

> Note: Implement `transcribeAudio`, `detectTopics`, and `summarizeTopic` with actual Deepgram API calls and logic.

### Conclusion

By integrating topic detection with summarization, you can enhance the processing of speech-to-text data, making it easier to digest and more informative. If issues persist or the system behavior seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Community](https://discord.gg/deepgram).

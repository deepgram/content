# Understanding Deepgram's Diarization Pricing

Deepgram offers advanced transcription services including features like speaker diarization. This feature identifies different speakers within an audio stream and is particularly useful for multi-speaker environments like meetings or interviews.

### Diarization in Deepgram
Diarization is the process of partitioning an input audio stream into segments according to the identity of the speaker, ensuring that each speaker’s segments are unique and separate. This enhances the transcription by attributing the spoken content to the correct individual, making the output more structured and informative.

### Pricing Model
Diarization does not incur an additional cost beyond the regular transcription fees you pay with Deepgram. Transcription services, including diarization, are priced based on usage, measured in terms of audio requests and the duration of audio processed. While there are no additional charges for enabling diarization, all transcription features are effectively part of your overall usage, which determines your monthly billing.

This usage-based pricing applies to all transcription features, including:
- Speaker Diarization
- Smart Formatting
- Automatic Language Detection
- Deep Search
- Keyword Boosting
- Multichannel Support

With this model, users can take full advantage of these powerful features without worrying about separate costs for each function.

### Making Pricing Work for You
To best utilize these features within your budget, consider the specific needs of your use case. If your application benefits from distinguishing between multiple speakers, diarization will be an invaluable feature. For projects focusing on simple speech-to-text conversion without the need to separate speakers, you could opt-out of diarization to streamline your processing.

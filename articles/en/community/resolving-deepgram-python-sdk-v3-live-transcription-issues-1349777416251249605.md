# Resolving Deepgram Python SDK v3.x Live Transcription Issues

In this documentation, we address common issues encountered when using the updated Deepgram Python SDK v3.x, specifically when implementing live transcription with the `DeepgramClient`. Users might face errors, such as `'DeepgramClient' object has no attribute 'transcription'` or `'Version' object is not callable`, which can be easily rectified by following the correct SDK implementation.

## Correcting SDK Initialization

When using the updated Deepgram Python SDK v3.x, it's crucial to understand the correct way to initialize and use the `DeepgramClient` for live transcription. The structure may differ from previous SDK versions, which might lead to confusion if the documentation is not thoroughly reviewed.

## Steps to Initialize and Use DeepgramClient

1. **Installation:** Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Deepgram Python SDK. You can update the SDK by running:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade deepgram
   ```

2. **Example Implementation:** Review and use the example applications provided in the [Deepgram Python SDK repository](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main/examples). These examples can guide you through correct and optimal SDK utilization.

3. **Correct Initialization:** Initialize the `DeepgramClient` following the recommended practices outlined in the examples. Ensuring the correct version of the SDK is being used is also critical.

## Example for Real-Time Transcription

For those looking to implement live transcription, referring to the [official Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/getting-started-with-live-streaming-audio) can be useful. This resource provides detailed insights into using WebSockets or other necessary configurations required for your development environment.

## Conclusion

These steps should assist in resolving issues encountered when utilizing the Deepgram Python SDK v3.x for live transcription tasks. By following these guidelines, users can better navigate potential pitfalls related to upgrading SDKs and align with best practices for using the `DeepgramClient`.

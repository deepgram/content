<CommunityQuestion>I haven't received any email notifications from Deepgram regarding my account's low credit balance. What could be causing this issue, and how can I resolve it?</CommunityQuestion>

If you are experiencing issues with not receiving emails from Deepgram, including important notifications such as low credit alerts, there are several steps and considerations to ensure proper email delivery.

### Initial Checks
1. **Spam Folder:** Always check your spam or junk email folder. It's possible that emails from Deepgram's domain have been inadvertently marked as spam by your email service provider. If you find emails there, mark them as "Not Spam" to ensure proper delivery in the future.

2. **Email Filters:** Inspect any email filters you may have set up which might direct Deepgram's emails to specific folders or trash. Adjust these settings to ensure your email client allows our emails into your primary inbox.

3. **Email Provider Notification:** Contact your email service provider to ensure the Deepgram domain is not being blocked or filtered due to security or anti-spam measures.

### Deepgram Project Settings
- Ensure you have the right contact email registered in your Deepgram Console account.
- As the project owner, you will receive billing receipts, overage alerts, and other account-related notifications.

### Credit and Usage Notifications
- **API Key Ownership:** Low credit usage notifications are sent to the owner of the API key that triggers these alerts. Ensure you are using API keys associated with your account if you wish to receive these alerts.

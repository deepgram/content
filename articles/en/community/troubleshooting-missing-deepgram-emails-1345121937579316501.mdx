<CommunityQuestion>I haven't received any email notifications from Deepgram regarding my account's low credit balance. What could be causing this issue, and how can I resolve it?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

Many users rely on Deepgram email notifications for critical updates, such as low credit alerts. Missing these emails can disrupt usage and lead to unexpected service interruptions. This guide provides steps to troubleshoot and resolve these issues.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - **Spam Folder:** Check your spam or junk email folder. Emails from Deepgram may be incorrectly marked as spam. If found, mark them as "Not Spam" to improve future delivery.
   - **Email Filters:** Review any filters that might redirect Deepgram's emails to specific folders or trash. Configure these filters to ensure emails are sent to your primary inbox.
   - **Email Provider Settings:** Confirm with your email service provider that Deepgram's domain is not blocked or filtered due to security settings.

2. **Deepgram Account Settings:**
   - Verify the contact email registered in your Deepgram Console account. Ensure it is the correct address for receiving notifications.
   - Only the project owner receives billing receipts, overage alerts, and account-related notifications. Check if you are listed as the project owner.

3. **API Key Ownership:**
   - Notifications about low credit usage are sent to the owner of the API key that triggers these alerts. Ensure your API keys are associated with your account if you wish to receive these alerts.

### Technical Considerations

- **Check Deepgram System Status:** Occasionally, system issues may affect email notifications. Visit [Deepgram Status](https://status.deepgram.com/) to check for any ongoing issues.
- **Alternative Email Address:** If issues persist, consider using a different email address to see if it resolves the problem.

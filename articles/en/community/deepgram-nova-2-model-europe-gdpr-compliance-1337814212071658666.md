# Using Deepgram's Nova 2 Model in Europe with GDPR Compliance

To use Deepgram's Nova 2 model for live transcription in a European call center while ensuring GDPR compliance, consider the following guidelines:

### Understanding GDPR Compliance
Deepgram is designed to be fully compliant with GDPR regulations. This compliance ensures that all data processing adheres to stringent data protection laws applicable in Europe. However, depending on your specific business needs, additional considerations may be necessary, particularly if you have strict data localization requirements.

### Establishing a Data Processing Agreement (DPA)
To facilitate GDPR compliance, especially when using Deepgram's API, setting up a Data Processing Agreement with Deepgram is advisable. This agreement includes Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to ensure compliant data transfers and processing. A DPA outlines the responsibilities of both parties in managing and processing personal data securely.

### Processing Within European Infrastructure
For businesses requiring that all data processing occur exclusively within Europe, a self-hosted deployment of Deepgramâ€™s models is an option:
- **Self-hosted Deployment**: This setup involves running the inference models on your own infrastructure located within Europe. This ensures that all data remains within the European boundaries throughout the processing phase.
- **Contact Deepgram**: For specific configurations or more tailored solutions, contacting Deepgram directly to discuss self-hosting options or managed services in Europe is recommended.

### Conclusion
Ensuring GDPR compliance when using Deepgram's services involves understanding both the default offerings and potential customization needs for data handling. Businesses with strict on-premise or regional processing needs may find the self-hosted deployment of Deepgram models a compelling solution to ensure they meet all regulatory compliance requirements.

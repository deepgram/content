<CommunityQuestion>I'm having trouble getting my Python script to properly process audio files asynchronously with Deepgram's API. The audio conversion works fine, but the async process seems to be hanging. What could be causing this issue?</CommunityQuestion>

### Problem Statement

When working with audio processing in an asynchronous Python environment, you might encounter situations where your application does not return the expected responses. This can occur even if your audio conversion from formats like alaw to linear16 @16Hz is correctly implemented, using tools such as [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). If audio conversion works independently, but async processing fails, here are some recommendations to consider:

### Understanding Async/Await in Python

Asynchronous programming allows you to perform tasks concurrently, making it ideal for tasks like I/O-bound operations. However, improper usage of async/await can lead to unresponsive code or missing results.

**Tips to Ensure Correct Usage:**
- **Proper Usage of `await`:** Make sure every asynchronous operation is preceded by an `await`. This ensures the function waits for the task to complete before proceeding.
- **Error Handling:** Use `try-except` blocks to catch unhandled exceptions that might disrupt the async flow.
- **Logging:** Implement logging to help trace the execution path and identify where the code might be hanging.

### Implementing Keep Alive

If your application stops receiving responses suddenly, it may be due to an expired WebSocket connection. Use Deepgram's [Keep Alive mechanism](/docs/audio-keep-alive) to maintain this connection:

**Example of WebSocket Keep Alive:**

```python
import asyncio
import websockets

async def send_keep_alive():
    uri = "wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"
    async with websockets.connect(uri, extra_headers={"Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"}) as websocket:
        while True:
            await websocket.send('{"action":"ping"}')
            print(await websocket.recv())
            await asyncio.sleep(30)  # Send keep-alive message every 30 seconds

asyncio.run(send_keep_alive())
```

### Additional Considerations

- **Dependencies:** Check that all your library versions are compatible and up-to-date.
- **Network Stability:** Ensure stable network conditions, particularly when dealing with WebSocket connections.
- **Isolated Testing:** Run the audio processing code in isolation to identify whether the issue lies within the async implementation or external factors.

### Conclusion

Troubleshooting an async/await issue requires attention to detail within your code structure and how your app handles I/O operations. By ensuring proper implementation of async functions, using error handling, and maintaining active connections with Keep Alive, many common issues can be resolved.

If issues persist or the system behaviour seems inconsistent, reach out to your Deepgram support representative (if you have one) or visit our community for assistance: [Deepgram Discord](https://discord.gg/deepgram) | [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/deepgram)

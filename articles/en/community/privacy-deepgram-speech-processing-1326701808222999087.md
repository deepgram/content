# Ensuring Privacy in Deepgram's Speech-to-Text Processes

Organizations integrating speech-to-text services often need to address privacy concerns regarding data handling, storage, and deletion. This is crucial for ensuring client trust and adhering to compliance standards.

## Privacy in Speech-to-Text Processing

Deepgram addresses privacy concerns comprehensively, providing clear insights into how data is managed from the moment it enters the system.

### Data Handling
When using Deepgram's speech-to-text services, data is processed over encrypted communication channels to ensure the confidentiality of the audio files.

### Data Storage
Audio files used for processing are not inherently stored long-term. However, temporary storage may occur, dependent on service configurations and user agreements such as participating in the Model Improvement Program (MIP).

### Model Improvement Program (MIP)
- **MIP Overview**: This is an optional program that allows Deepgram to use your audio data to improve its models. It operates only with consent. More details can be found on the [MIP documentation page](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/the-deepgram-model-improvement-partnership-program).
- **Data Handling in MIP**: Participating audio files may be used to train and enhance algorithms, but strict security measures are implemented to protect privacy.

### Data Retention and Deletion
If not participating in MIP, processed data isn't stored beyond its processing window unless explicitly requested or agreed upon. Deepgram employs mechanisms for data destruction where applicable.

### Security Compliance
Deepgram's systems are designed to align with industry standards for privacy and security, ensuring that audio data is handled with the highest level of integrity.

## Conclusion
Understanding how Deepgram addresses privacy can assure clients and partners that their data is managed securely and responsibly. By specifying participation in the MIP, they retain the choice over how their data is used for potential service improvements.

# Handling Payment Declines on Deepgram Subscriptions

When managing ongoing Deepgram subscriptions, encountering payment declines can pose significant administrative hurdles. However, proactively addressing common causes and solutions can aid in a smooth transaction process.

## Understanding Declines

Payment declines can arise due to various reasons, typically falling within two categories: 
1. **Issues from the Card Issuer:** This includes instances such as insufficient funds or fraud alerts triggered within the financial institution's system.
2. **Stripe Radar Triggers:** Stripe, which Deepgram utilizes for processing payments, incorporates an automated system, Radar, to prevent fraudulent transactions. At times, genuine transactions may get flagged, requiring manual intervention.

## Steps to Resolve Payment Declines

1. **Verify Card Information:** Ensure that the card details are entered correctly, including the CVV, expiration date, and cardholder name.
2. **Contact Card Issuer:** Reach out to your bank or card issuer to verify if there are any blocks or flags on the card. They might need to authorize certain transactions, especially for significant amounts or international payments.
3. **Review Alternate Payment Methods:** If continuous declines occur, consider using a different card or payment method. This might include utilizing business credit cards, if personal ones encounter limitations.
4. **Stripe Support:** On rare occasions, requesting the card's unique transaction ID from Stripe might provide additional insights into why declines continually occur. This information can be acquired by the vendor's support team.

## Special Cases: High-Value Transactions

For substantial transactions, Deepgram provides an alternative solution through wire transfer options linked to more significant plans, such as the $4,000 growth plan. This path bypasses typical card processing and mandates direct bank-to-bank transactions:
* **Contact Sales:** If you're moving to a growth-tier plan, contact Deepgram support or the sales department to initiate a direct wire transfer. 
* **Wire Transfer Conditions:** Pre-paying for credits through this method usually applies to higher usage plans and minimizes the administrative burden on both parties.

## Conclusion

Solving payment delays and declines starts with understanding potential triggers and taking proactive steps to mitigate them. While subscription automation offers convenience, understanding manual options like wire transfers for high-value agreements can provide needed flexibility.

By managing payment expectations and fixes methodically, Deepgram users can ensure seamless service continuity.

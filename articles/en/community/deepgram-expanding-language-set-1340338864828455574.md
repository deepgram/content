# Expanding Deepgram's Supported Language Set for Speech-to-Text

Deepgram consistently seeks to enhance the language capabilities of its speech-to-text API, though no specific timelines exist for new language inclusions. The latest expansion, "Nova 2," was achieved in [May 2023](https://deepgram.com/learn/nova-2-speech-to-text-api-expands-to-36-languages), marking the addition of 36 languages.

As part of our agile roadmap, further languages are continually evaluated for inclusion based on user demand and strategic alignment with Deepgram's goals. For those interested in specific language support, such as Armenian, participating in our [community forums](https://discord.gg/deepgram) to express your interest can highlight the demand and potentially expedite evaluation.

To stay informed of language support expansions, subscribing to updates via the community and following our documentation releases is beneficial.

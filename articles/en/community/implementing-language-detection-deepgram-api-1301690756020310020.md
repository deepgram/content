# Implementing Language Detection with Deepgram API

Language detection is an important feature offered by the Deepgram API which enables users to automatically identify the language being spoken in an audio file. Although this feature isn't available in the API Playground, developers can still integrate it into their applications by following the documentation provided by Deepgram.

### Understanding Language Detection

Deepgram's language detection can process audio files and return the language code for the dominant language recognized in the speech. This can be crucial for applications that need to handle multiple languages dynamically, such as transcription services, multi-lingual customer support, or language-specific content analysis.

### How to Use Language Detection

To access language detection, developers need to use the specific Deepgram API endpoint that supports it. Language detection is supported in both pre-recorded audio and live streaming, making it versatile for various applications.

1. **Pre-recorded Audio**:
   - API endpoint: `https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen`
   - Make sure to include the appropriate parameters for language detection as outlined in the Deepgram documentation.
   
2. **Live Streaming Audio**:
   - API endpoint: `wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen`
   - Set up a WebSocket connection and include language detection in the parameters.

### Conclusion

While the API Playground does not currently support language detection, developers can seamlessly incorporate this feature into their projects by leveraging the Deepgram API and using the sample code provided above. Itâ€™s important to refer to the official [Deepgram Language Detection Documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/language-detection) for a detailed guide on setting it up properly based on your needs.

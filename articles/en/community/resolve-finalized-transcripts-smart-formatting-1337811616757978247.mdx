<CommunityQuestion>I've been using the Deepgram Speech-to-Text API, but sometimes the finalised transcripts differ from the interim ones, even though the interim transcripts seemed accurate. What could be causing this discrepancy?</CommunityQuestion>

## Understanding the Issue

When using Deepgram's Speech-to-Text API, discrepancies may occur between interim and finalised transcripts. This often stems from specific configuration parameters used during API requests. Notably, using both `numerals` and `smart_format` parameters can lead to conflicts, resulting in empty or incorrect finalised transcripts.

### Parameters Overview

- **`numerals` Parameter:** Converts spoken numbers into digit format (e.g., "twenty" to "20").
- **`smart_format` Parameter:** Automatically formats numbers, dates, times, and more, optimising for specific language models.

Using both parameters may cause conflicts, as they attempt to format numbers simultaneously. It is advisable to use either `numerals` or `smart_format`, but not both, to avoid discrepancies.

## Solution

To resolve these inconsistencies, review and adjust your API request parameters:

1. **Disable One of the Parameters:** If you're using `smart_format`, especially with English models, consider disabling `numerals`. Smart Formatting should adequately handle number formatting.

   ```shell
   curl -X POST "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen" \
   -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
   -F "file=@/path/to/audio.wav" \
   -F "smart_format=true"
   ```

2. **Ensure Compatibility:** Verify that the parameters chosen align with your desired outcomes and are compatible with one another. Review Deepgram's [API documentation](/docs/api-reference) for parameter specifics.

## Error Handling

If discrepancies persist, consider the following error handling strategies:

- Check for error messages in API responses indicating parameter conflicts.
- Use logging to track when and where discrepancies occur in the transcription process.
- Experiment with different parameter combinations in a controlled environment to identify the optimal setup.

## Community Support

For persistent issues or further assistance, consult the Deepgram community resources:

- [Deepgram Community on Discord](../community) for real-time support.
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk/discussions) for community-driven solutions.

## Conclusion

Choosing either `smart_format` or individual formatting parameters like `numerals` can help prevent transcription discrepancies in your Deepgram results. For more details, refer to the [Smart Formatting documentation](/docs/smart-format).

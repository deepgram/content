<CommunityQuestion>I've accidentally created multiple Deepgram accounts using different email addresses and third-party logins. How can I consolidate these accounts into a single one without losing my existing credits and API keys?</CommunityQuestion>

## Problem Statement

Many users inadvertently create multiple Deepgram accounts using different email addresses or third-party logins like GitHub. This can result in fragmented usage of credits and API keys. Consolidating these accounts into a single account is crucial for managing resources effectively.

## Understanding Account Creation and Linking

Deepgram allows for account creation using standard email registration or third-party services like GitHub. You might find yourself with two separate accounts, each with different balances and API keys, if you've created one account via email and another through GitHub.

### Checking Your Account Status

To verify the details of your accounts:
1. Log into the Deepgram Console at `/console`.
2. Navigate through the project selector at the top left to view active project IDs and verify available balances.

## Steps to Merge the Accounts

To consolidate accounts, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Project IDs**
   - Access each account and note the project configurations, specifically the *Project IDs* for both accounts.

2. **Communicate with Deepgram Support**
   - Contact Deepgram support via email at `devrel@deepgram.com` or other support channels.
   - Provide the Project IDs and explain your request for account consolidation.

3. **Deepgram Action**
   - The Deepgram team will process your request to merge credits and API keys into one account.
   - They will ensure the secondary account is closed without affecting your primary account.

4. **Confirmation**
   - You will receive a confirmation once your accounts have been merged. Verify this by checking the balance and API keys through your Deepgram Console settings.

## Final Advice

Always ensure you are working under the correct project within your Deepgram Console to prevent inconsistencies. If credits are mistakenly added to the wrong account, prompt communication with support can rectify this.

<CommunityQuestion>I've accidentally created multiple Deepgram accounts using different email addresses and third-party logins. How can I consolidate these accounts into a single one without losing my existing credits and API keys?</CommunityQuestion>

When using Deepgram services, you might find yourself with multiple accounts created using different authentication methods such as email and third-party logins like GitHub. This guide will walk you through consolidating multiple Deepgram accounts into a single account while ensuring all credits and API keys are retained.

## Understanding Account Creation and Linking

Deepgram allows for account creation using either a standard email registration or through third-party services like GitHub. Consider the scenario where you accidentally create one account using your email and another via GitHub. Linking the GitHub account to the same email as the existing account can lead to the situation where two separate accounts exist with different balances and API keys.

### Checking Your Account Status

To verify the details of your accounts:
1. Log into Deepgram Console at [https://console.deepgram.com](https://console.deepgram.com).
2. Navigate through the project selector at the top left to see the active project IDs and verify the available balances.

## Steps to Merge the Accounts

To consolidate accounts:

1. **Identify Project IDs**
   - Access each account and note the project configurations. You will need to identify the *Project IDs* for both accounts.

2. **Communicate with Deepgram Support**
   - Send an email to `devrel@deepgram.com` or reach out through other support channels.
   - Provide the Project IDs and explain the consolidation request.

3. **Deepgram Action**
   - Deepgram's team will process your request to merge credits and API keys into one account.
   - They will also ensure the secondary account is closed without affecting your primary account.

4. **Confirmation**
   - You will receive a confirmation once your accounts have been merged. You can verify this by checking the balance and API keys through your Deepgram Console settings.

## Final Advice

Always ensure you are working under the correct project within your Deepgram Console to prevent inconsistencies. If you have mistakenly topped up the incorrect account, prompt communication with support can rectify this.

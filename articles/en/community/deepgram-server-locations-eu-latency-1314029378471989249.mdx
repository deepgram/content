<CommunityQuestion>I'm building an application that will utilise Deepgram's speech-to-text API, and my servers are located in the UK. What should I consider regarding latency and server locations?</CommunityQuestion>

For users or servers based in Europe leveraging Deepgram's APIs, understanding data centre locations and latency considerations is crucial to optimise performance, especially for real-time streaming use cases.

## Deepgram Data Centre Locations

Deepgram operates data centres in the following regions:

- **US East**
- **US West**

These locations are strategic for global access, but users in Europe should consider the potential latency impact due to transatlantic data travel.

### Impact on European Users

European users may experience higher latency when connecting to US-based data centres. Factors influencing latency include network provider performance, current network conditions, and the specific routing path taken.

## Optimising API Usage

To mitigate latency issues, consider the following best practices:

- **Network Optimisation:** Work with your network provider to ensure the fastest path to US data centres.
- **API Request Configuration:** Optimise API requests by using smaller audio chunks for live streaming to reduce processing time.

### Implementing Connection Management

Efficient connection management can also help reduce latency:

```python
import websocket
import json

def on_message(ws, message):
    print("Received:", message)

def on_error(ws, error):
    print("Error:", error)

def on_close(ws):
    print("Connection closed")

def on_open(ws):
    print("Connection opened")
    # Example of sending a message
    ws.send(json.dumps({"type": "start", "content": "Hello Deepgram!"}))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    websocket.enableTrace(True)
    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen",
                                on_message=on_message,
                                on_error=on_error,
                                on_close=on_close)
    ws.on_open = on_open
    ws.run_forever()
```

### Alternative Solutions: Self-Hosting

Consider self-hosting Deepgram solutions to eliminate network delays by leveraging local processing power. This can significantly reduce latency for real-time applications.

### Error Resolution

- **Common Latency Error:** "Network delay detected"
  - **Resolution:** Review network paths and optimise routing to US data centres. Consider alternative network providers if persistent.
